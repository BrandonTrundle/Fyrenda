Barnaby’s earliest memory is cold stone, an empty alley, and the quiet weight of a creature no one else could see. He was six—maybe younger—and alone except for the small, floating aberration that hovered near him like a guardian shadow. One eye, curling horn nubs, and tentacles that twitched with nerves and emotions it could barely control. Barnaby didn’t know its name; he simply felt it. The creature whispered in a language that scraped the inside of his skull—Deep Speech, though he wouldn’t learn that word until much later. Eventually he decided to call it Gerry.

## Survival of the Fittest
Barnaby had no memory of parents, no flashes of a home, nothing but Gerry and an instinctual sense that something had gone terribly wrong before he woke up in that alley. He survived the way street kids do: stealing, hiding, keeping his head down. The others avoided him because he “talked to empty air” and had the unnerving habit of predicting things—weather changes, incoming guards, lost items—almost by accident. It wasn’t insight; it was Gerry’s psychic nudges bleeding through him.

## Adolescence
When he hit his teens, the tricks sharpened into something profitable. He reinvented himself as a travelling soothsayer, a fortune-teller, a charlatan—whatever brought coin and a roof for the night. He never stayed long. Sooner or later the locals noticed the oddities: candles flickering when he got emotional, glimpses of something squirming in the corner of their vision, or the way animals avoided him entirely. When things got too strange or too dangerous, Barnaby vanished to the next town with Gerry in tow.

But the power kept growing. And Gerry kept getting… louder.

## Reason for Adventuring
Then the dreams began. A voice without words. A pull. A direction. Always toward the same place: Takari.

Barnaby tried to ignore it, but sorcerous magic doesn’t wait for permission. When he cast without thinking, Gerry flickered into visibility for brief moments—violent, glitchy snapshots that left Barnaby trembling and unsure if he was losing his mind. Eventually the pressure became too much. The calling wasn’t just a feeling anymore; it was a compulsion woven through his veins.

He followed it.

Now, standing at the edge of Takari, Barnaby knows two things:

Whatever ties him to Gerry didn’t begin in that alley.
There’s a reason he has no memories before age six. Something erased them—or sealed them away.

The force pulling him here is older than him, older than Gerry, and possibly older than the nightmares strangling Takari.

Barnaby doesn’t know if he’s walking toward answers, danger, or both. He doesn’t know if Gerry is a guardian, a parasite, or a key. All he knows is this: the closer he gets to Takari’s heart, the stronger the connection becomes. And whatever waits for him in the shadowed streets may finally reveal who he is… or what he was meant for.

## Barnaby's History
Barnaby was not born in the Material Plane at all. His first breath was drawn in **Drataria**, the vast and shifting dream-realm forged from the subconscious of the sleeping god Somnurex. His father was a Yuan-Ti of Isskavuun—one of Durak Takari’s own serpent-blooded descendants—who met a brutal end after defying Durak’s authority. In Isskavuun, disobedience is answered with blood, and with her mate executed and her unborn child already marked by a **Yuan-Ti sigil** that branded him as the son of a traitor, Barnaby’s mother knew her baby would not survive long under Durak’s reign. Barnaby’s conception had been touched by more than lineage; he was born during one of Somnurex’s rare surges of heightened dreaming, moments when divine emotion spilled into the world and twisted the laws of nature. The god’s dream-stuff seeped into Barnaby’s forming soul, granting him latent, unstable power—and placing him in even greater danger among a people who feared anything outside their rigid hierarchy.

Desperate to save him, Barnaby’s mother turned to an ancient act of faith and desperation. When Barnaby was only a newborn, she placed him into a small vessel and set him adrift upon the **River Somniri**, Somnurex’s living bloodstream that wound through Drataria like a divine artery. Most who entered the Somniri were lost forever, but she believed the god who had unintentionally infused her child might still protect him. Against all odds, the infant washed up onto a stony embankment where he was discovered by a **Couatl who dwelled in Drataria**—a celestial whose form had endured centuries of exposure to dream magic without losing her compassionate heart. She sensed the child’s radiant potential immediately, recognized the danger clinging to him, and chose to raise him in a cavern hidden within the petrified ribs of a Stone Giant formation.

For six quiet years the Couatl nurtured him, teaching him the beginnings of language, kindness, and stability. She was not alone—her closest companion, a being Barnaby would one day dimly remember as “Gerry,” lived with her. In Drataria, Gerry had once been a powerful dream-spirit, a creature formed from the subconscious fears and instincts of Somnurex himself. He was immense, articulate, and fiercely protective, nothing like the fractured aberration that would later cling to Barnaby on the Material Plane. The Couatl and Gerry loved the boy in their own strange ways, shielding him as best they could from Drataria’s harsher truths: its serpentine tyrants, its shifting dunes of memory, and the monstrous remnants of the First Takarians.

But peace in Drataria is as fragile as thought, and everything changed when a violent surge tore across the realm—the moment **Valla Rynn**, far away in the Material Plane, carried a shard of Lysdara??Ts staff into the sealed chamber and inadvertently cracked the ward holding Somnurex in his slumber. The Couatl felt it instantly. Her cave trembled, glowing from within as dreamlight bled through the walls. Rifts flickered open where no rifts should be, thin and unstable, but leading into the Material Plane. It was a fleeting miracle—a doorway the Couatl knew would not remain.

With sorrow and urgency, she prepared Barnaby for escape. She pressed her luminous feathers against his skin and murmured an ancient spell, **sealing away his Yuan-Ti birthmark** beneath layers of celestial and dream-forged magic. The spell dulled his earliest memories, suppressed hints of serpent heritage, and hid the truth of his divine-touched soul from anyone who might seek to exploit or destroy him. The last thing she ever gave him was anonymity—a chance to live without the shadow of Isskavuun upon him.

As the portal began to collapse, she turned to Gerry, knowing she could never pass through with them. “Take him,” she urged, her voice trembling with fear and faith. Gerry, still whole and mighty, gathered the trembling six-year-old into his jaws in a gentle, protective grip and leapt through the thinning tear in reality. The Couatl watched them vanish into the foreign light before the portal snapped shut, sealing her forever on the far side.

Crossing into the Material Plane shattered Gerry. The realm’s physics crushed his mind and body, warping him into the flickering, child-sized aberration that now circles Barnaby like a glitch in the air. He still remembered the boy, remembered love, danger, and loss—but his thoughts fractured into whispers and impulses, incapable of articulating the truth. Alone, disoriented, and weakened, Gerry carried Barnaby as far as he could before depositing him in a quiet alley of a distant settlement, watching over him like a broken guardian.

Barnaby woke in that alley with **no memory** of the dream-realm, no name for his lineage, and no understanding of the flickering entity that hovered protectively over him. He grew up believing he was simply strange, simply cursed, simply… different. But the truth lay much deeper:
Barnaby Thromwell is a refugee from a god’s dream—a child born under a divine surge, smuggled out by celestial sacrifice, and watched over by a shattered guardian from a world that was never meant to touch the one he now walks. And the closer he draws to Takari and to Somnurex’s sealed mountain, the more the dream remembers him… and the more his forgotten past begins to bleed back into waking reality.
