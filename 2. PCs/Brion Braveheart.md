## [[Luckshire]]
Brion Braveheart was born in Luckshire, a merchant town known for fat coin purses, loud markets, and caravans that never stopped rolling in and out. 

## The Perfect Life
The Braveheart family fit right in—renowned traders dealing in rare spices, imported silks, and anything exotic enough to catch a noble’s wandering eye. They weren’t royalty, but in Luckshire, their name meant status, connections, and security.

## The Disaster
That all collapsed in a single night. When Brion was still a teenager, his family’s caravan was ambushed on a remote trade route. Bandits tore through guards, wagons, and merchants alike. Brion barely survived. His parents didn’t. The surviving merchants picked apart what was left of the Braveheart fortune, and in days the family’s empire was ashes.

## Pride vs. Fear
Brion was left with nothing—no coin, no home, and no one who cared enough to help rebuild. Worse, he carried something heavier than poverty: fear. Real fear. The kind that sinks into your bones and stays there. Every shadow reminded him of that night. Every sudden sound made his chest tighten. Danger terrifies him, even now. But pride is a powerful thing.

## Reason for Adventuring
Brion refuses to let the Braveheart name die. So he does what he can: he fakes it. He tells embellished tales of heroic feats and dangerous travels. He dresses in clothes that *look* expensive—at least from a distance. He talks like a seasoned merchant while clutching a mostly empty coin purse. To nobles and wealthy traders, he plays the part of a confident, successful entrepreneur. To himself, he plays the part of the man he wishes he was.

Under the polished exterior, though, he’s still that scared hobbit on a ruined trade road—trying to convince the world, and himself, that he can reclaim a legacy that was stolen from him.

His dream is simple: rebuild what his parents built. Restore the Braveheart name. Become the merchant prince his father always believed he’d grow into.
His reality is much messier: fear, half-truths, borrowed confidence, and a hope he’s barely keeping alive.

But he keeps going anyway. Because the Braveheart name deserves more than ashes, and he refuses to be the one who lets it fade.
