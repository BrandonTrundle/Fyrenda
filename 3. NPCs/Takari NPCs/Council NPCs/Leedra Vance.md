Leedra Vance is Takari’s sharpest economic weapon and its most dangerous optimist. She views the city through ledgers, contracts, and projections, believing that prosperity is the only true defense Takari has ever possessed. To her, Lumenfell ore is not sacred?it is leverage. Control the resource, and you control the future.

Unlike many councilors, Leedra is unapologetic about her self-interest. She believes her success and Takari’s success are inseparable, and she is not entirely wrong. Her trade networks reach far beyond the Lumenfell Range, making the city indispensable to regional commerce. When caravans move, they move on her terms.

Leedra dismisses superstition, ancient warnings, and emotional arguments as inefficiencies. She acknowledges danger, but only as a factor to be mitigated, not a reason to stop. To her, the past collapse was not a lesson in restraint—it was a lesson in lost opportunity.

What Leedra truly fears is stagnation. A Takari that stops growing is, in her eyes, already dying.
