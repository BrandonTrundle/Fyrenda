# ===== ROLEPLAY INFO =====
personality_traits: |
  Speaks quickly when anxious and slows down when considering something deeply. She often trails off mid-sentence when connecting details in her head. She keeps her hands clasped together when nervous, as though steadying herself.

ideals: |
  Every person in Takari deserves truth, safety, and leadership free of manipulation. Knowledge should protect people, not be used to control them.

bonds: |
  Deeply loyal to the Council of Takari and personally close to Zozno and Dekra. Feels responsible for sounding the alarm about Thorne’s suspicious behavior. Desperately wants to protect the city.

flaws: |
  Blames herself too harshly for not acting sooner. Freezes in moments of emotional overwhelm. Struggles to admit fear, even when in danger.

goals: |
  Short-term: Warn the party about Father Thorne, survive her injuries, and locate Dekra before the cult uses him in the ritual.
  Long-term: Restore the Council’s integrity, expose Thorne’s ties to Somnurex, and help end the Endless Night without resorting to forbidden rites.

background: |
  Julia was trained as a historian specializing in Takarian political history. Her insight and empathy earned her a council seat at a young age. The day before her disappearance, she discovered Thorne speaking in hushed, ritualistic tones with robed figures wearing blue and gold—the colors associated with Somnurex. Unsure of the truth and unwilling to accuse a priest without proof, she told Zozno instead. Their attempt to quietly investigate led them into the Lumenfell Forest, where ambushers struck. Dekra was dragged into the mountain tunnels, and Julia escaped only barely before collapsing in the clearing.

# ⭐ **Physical Description 

A young woman with quick, intelligent eyes that flick between people and details with restless precision. Her brown hair is twisted into a loose braid that has partially fallen apart from her recent struggle. Dirt and scrapes mark her face and arms, but underneath the grime she carries the posture of someone who is used to being listened to. Her breathing is uneven, but her expression remains fierce and alert, as though refusing to succumb to panic.

---

# ⭐ **Personality, Wants, and Background 

Julia is a deeply empathetic scholar whose intellect drives her to connect details others overlook. She wants safety for Takari, restoration of honest leadership, and to prevent Thorne from completing a ritual that could drown the city in nightmare. She desires clarity, justice, and the chance to make up for her hesitation. Her mind works quickly—sometimes too quickly—and when presented with danger, she tends to freeze for a heartbeat before regaining her composure. Above all, she fears losing the people she cares about—Zozno, Dekra, and the citizens of Takari she swore to protect.

## Archivist, Councilor, Relentless Historian

Julia is a scholar who long ago stopped pretending that knowledge is neutral. As both Educative Magistrate on the **Council of Takari** and a leading figure within the **Archivist Circle**, she exists at the intersection of truth and power—fully aware that the two rarely coexist peacefully. Julia is respected for her intellect, tolerated for her persistence, and quietly feared for how much she knows.

She approaches history as an active force rather than a passive record. To Julia, forgotten events do not disappear; they resurface in altered forms—policy failures, repeated disasters, cultural blind spots. Her work focuses on identifying these patterns, cross-referencing ancient inscriptions, mining logs, religious texts, and civic decrees to expose where Takari has already walked itself into catastrophe. She believes most tragedies are not mysteries, but _ignored warnings_.

Julia’s manner is blunt, precise, and unsentimental. She does not soften conclusions for political comfort and has little patience for ideological arguments that dismiss evidence. This has earned her open hostility from the Lantern Faith and wary resistance from economic interests that benefit from selective memory. Still, she remains difficult to remove; her command of precedent and law makes direct suppression costly.

Unlike many scholars, Julia is not detached from the present. She actively advises on policy, education reform, and archive access, believing that controlled ignorance is more dangerous than panic. Her insistence on transparency places her in constant tension with factions invested in secrecy—but she considers that friction proof she is doing her job.

Jullia does not believe Takari is cursed. She believes it is _forgetful_. And she is determined not to let the city survive another century by repeating the same mistakes with different names.
