Dethrick Thornwall is the council’s memory made flesh. Reserved, methodical, and relentlessly patient, he speaks only when necessary—and when he does, his words carry the weight of precedent rather than opinion. He believes law exists not to inspire, but to _endure_.

Dethrick was instrumental in codifying post-collapse regulations, sealing dangerous tunnels, and preserving surviving records from the Ancient Takarian era. He distrusts improvisation and deeply resents attempts to rewrite history for convenience. To him, Takari’s laws are not obstacles to progress, but guardrails against repeating catastrophe.

Unlike others on the council, Dethrick does not believe Takari needs to expand to survive. He believes it needs to remember. Every sealed gate, every restricted archive, every enforced boundary is, to him, an act of mercy toward future generations.

His greatest concern is not what the city might uncover—but what it might choose to ignore once uncovered.
