## Councilor of Infrastructure & City Works

Dekra Billinger does not see Takari as a city. She sees it as a **load-bearing argument**—one that has already failed once and is being rebuilt on assumptions no one wants to examine too closely. As the Councilor of Infrastructure and City Works, she is responsible for tunnels, seals, lifts, bridges, aqueducts, waste channels, and structural reinforcement. In reality, she is the person who decides **how much of the past the city is willing to stand on**.

Unlike her public-facing counterpart in education, Dekra’s work is not theoretical. She walks the sealed corridors. She reviews collapse reports line by line. She cross-references ancient fault patterns with modern stress fractures and finds the same shapes repeating. Her authority comes not from charisma or politics, but from documentation so thorough that arguing with her feels like arguing with gravity. When Dekra says a section of the city is unsafe, she can usually prove that it has _always_ been unsafe.

Dekra’s leadership style is methodical, cold, and uncompromising. She does not negotiate with deadlines, budgets, or public pressure. She believes infrastructure failure is the purest form of truth—stone does not lie, and tunnels do not care about intent. This puts her in constant conflict with the Lumenfell Consortium and Vance Industries, both of whom push for speed and expansion. Dekra blocks them not with rhetoric, but with injunctions, reinforcement orders, and sealed access codes that take months to overturn.

Her relationship with Mayor Valla Rynn is tense but respectful. Valla trusts Dekra’s judgment, even when it slows momentum or angers powerful interests. Dekra, in turn, respects Valla’s willingness to listen—something she does not take for granted. The two do not agree often, but when they do, entire districts change shape. When they don’t, Dekra still enforces safety first, daring anyone to challenge her in writing.

Privately, Dekra is deeply unsettled by what she has found beneath Takari. Not because of monsters or magic, but because of **intentional design**—supports that don’t align with modern engineering, tunnels that curve away from stress instead of through it, sealed chambers placed where they _shouldn’t_ be necessary. She suspects the First Takarians were not merely digging recklessly, but **building around something**. This belief has made her cautious to the point of obsession, and it fuels her refusal to reopen certain depths under any circumstances.

Dekra Billinger does not believe Takari will fall tomorrow. She believes it will fall the moment someone convinces themselves that this time will be different. Her job is not to inspire the city. Her job is to make sure it still exists when inspiration fails.
