Zozno Kalarsh is Takari’s most unsettling asset: brilliant, charismatic, and profoundly aware that the city rests atop forces it does not understand. As an arcane scholar and bardic polymath, he bridges disciplines others keep separate—magic, history, myth, and lived experience. He does not speculate about danger; he recognizes its patterns.

Zozno’s insights have prevented multiple disasters, yet they have also made him a figure of quiet suspicion. He speaks openly about instability, dream-magic, and resonance beneath the city, concepts most councilors would prefer to dismiss. When meetings grow uncomfortable, it is usually because Zozno has named something others sensed but refused to articulate.

He walks a thin line between trusted advisor and tolerated alarmist. His reputation protects him—for now—but his willingness to confront buried truths places him at odds with factions invested in control and silence.

Zozno does not fear what sleeps beneath Takari. He fears what will happen when the city realizes it has been listening all along.
