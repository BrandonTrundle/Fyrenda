# ===== ROLEPLAY INFO =====
physical_description: |
  A slender, middle-aged woman with ink-stained fingertips and sharp gray eyes that never stop scanning the room. Ash-brown hair is pinned in a practical coil, secured by two bone styluses that double as hairpins. She wears layered library robes in muted umber with stitched inner pockets and a slim chain of brass keys at her waist. Her voice is low and steady, carrying the cadence of someone used to reading aloud in candlelit halls. She smells faintly of vellum, cedar oil, and lamp smoke.

personality: |
  Precise, patient, and quietly stubborn. She values truth over comfort, protects the vulnerable through information, and distrusts anyone who treats history as a tool for power. She is slow to trust but fiercely loyal once proven wrong about someone.

way_of_speaking: |
  Measured and deliberate, with short sentences and careful word choice. She often pauses to select the right term, prefers formal titles, and rarely raises her voice.

personality_traits: |
  Speaks softly but precisely, often pausing to weigh a word. Keeps calm even when threatened.

ideals: |
  Truth is fragile and must be protected, even from those who want it for good reasons.

bonds: |
  Loyal to the Archivist Circle and to a hidden collection of forbidden records she refuses to abandon.

flaws: |
  Paranoid about surveillance and prone to withholding information until trust is proven.

  Short term: identify who is redacting Takari's records. Long term: restore a missing year to the city's archive.

background: |
  A senior cataloger in the Lantern Library who quietly maintains forbidden ledgers and the Circle's private cipher keys.
