**[[Hephaestus]]** is counted among the original gods of Freyenda, a primeval force whose existence predates worship, language, and even the ordering of the world itself. Where other gods embody ideals or emotions, Hephaestus embodies _process_: the slow, deliberate act of shaping chaos into something that lasts. Fire, pressure, repetition, and restraint are his true domains. In the oldest myths, he is not depicted as a ruler or judge, but as a constant presence—working, refining, and setting the bones of reality into place.

In the earliest age, when Freyenda was still unstable and divine power flowed without boundary, Hephaestus imposed limitation. Mountains hardened because he allowed them to cool. Rivers cut paths because he defined how stone must yield. Even the gods were not exempt from his influence; many of the unspoken laws that govern divine interaction are attributed to his hand. He was not feared, but respected, for to oppose Hephaestus was to oppose inevitability itself.

Unlike later gods, Hephaestus never sought dominion over mortals. He taught through example rather than decree. His followers—craftspeople, masons, smiths, and builders—believed that mastery was a form of worship and that endurance was the highest virtue. Temples to Hephaestus were rare and utilitarian, often indistinguishable from workshops or foundries. To honor him was not to pray, but to finish what one began and accept the consequences of creation.

As the pantheon grew more complex, Hephaestus withdrew from direct involvement in divine politics. He observed rather than intervened, trusting that systems, once set, would reveal their strengths and failures in time. This distance earned him a reputation as cold or indifferent, but those who studied his myths understood the truth: Hephaestus did not value intent, only outcome. Good intentions could still produce ruin. Careless brilliance could still collapse.

Many of the greatest artifacts in Freyenda are attributed—directly or indirectly—to Hephaestus. Some were forged by his hand, others merely followed principles he established. These creations are often marked by durability rather than beauty, function over ornament. Legends claim that even flawed works associated with Hephaestus endure far longer than intended, refusing to fully break, as though permanence itself resists abandonment.

In the current age, Hephaestus is seldom invoked by name, yet his influence is everywhere. Every standing wall, every surviving road, every structure that has endured war, weather, and time bears his silent signature. He does not demand remembrance. He does not seek forgiveness. He simply continues his work, unseen and uncelebrated, ensuring that when the world breaks—as all things eventually do—it breaks along lines he has already prepared.
