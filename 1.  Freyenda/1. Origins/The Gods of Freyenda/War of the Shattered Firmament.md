### _Excerpt from an old historian who studied the War of the Shattered Firmament:_

_"Historical records fail to pinpoint the precise moment when the Gods began shaping the land. What **is** certain—recorded across tablets, oral accounts, and fragmented celestial charts—is that [[Korvath the Storm-Eater]] struck the very first blow."_  
—[[Grorg Tinkerbeetle]], gnomish historian of the First Age, [[College of Bricksworth]] in [[Luckshire]]

## **Historical Records**

The true beginning of the divine conflict is lost to time. What remains are legends, half-remembered chants, and the rare inscriptions that survived divine wrath. These sources all agree on one point: **[[Korvath the Storm-Eater]] struck the opening blow** that ignited the war.

The earliest phase of battle centered on how the gods would divide the land they were about to shape. According to tradition, it was **[[Toruun]]**, with his mighty hammer, who drove the first mountains upward from the molten firmament. His brother, **[[Korvath the Storm-Eater]]**, answered by carving out the first seas with storms so violent they split the infant world open.

In time, other divine entities joined the shaping. **[[Sarynth the Embermother]]** birthed the planet’s first volcanoes; the greatest of these, **[[Mount Sarynth]]**, she named for herself in a moment of fiery triumph.

## **Scandalous**

As the first lands formed, so did the gods’ boredom. From their desires, rivalries, fears, and dreams, new deities emerged into the world. **[[Merethyn]]** was born from a single tear shed by [[Korvath]]. The twins **[[Grondar]]** and **[[Lysdara]]** sparked into being when a bolt of lightning—cast again and again by [[Toruun]] who finally struck the earth with such force it split their essences free.

During this era, a great **plethora of [[Demi-Gods]]** were fashioned to fulfill the gods’ hungers—whether for battle, companionship, or subtler temptations. These creations, however, only deepened the rivalries among the divine.

Eventually the tensions grew unbearable.

Thus began the catastrophe later known as **the War of the Shattered Firmament**, when gods, their offspring, and their creations turned their power upon one another—and upon the world that had barely formed beneath them.

#  **The War of the Shattered Firmament**

## **I. The First Blow — When Storm Met Stone**

Before the world had continents, before seas had depth, before mortals had breath, the heavens were a molten lattice of raw creation — turbulent, bright, and painfully new.

In this swirling firmament, two brothers quarreled.

**[[Toruun]]**, the Shaper of Strength and Memory, envisioned creation as a place of permanence — mountains that endured, stones that remembered, foundations that could not be undone.

**[[Korvath the Storm-Eater]]**, whose veins ran with lightning and cosmic fury, envisioned motion — roaring oceans, skies torn open by storm, a world forever in motion.

Their visions could not coexist.

And so Korvath, impatient and burning with pride, gathered a storm so vast it dimmed the newborn stars. With a cry that split the forming heavens, he hurled a bolt of astral lightning into the shaping void.

That bolt struck Toruun’s half-formed mountains.

**It was the first blow.**  
**The blow that broke the sky.**

The mountains shuddered. Stone liquefied. The heavens ruptured like glass.

This moment would come to be remembered — and feared — as the beginning of the **War of the Shattered Firmament**.

---

## **II. The Creation of Battlefields**

Enraged, Toruun answered Korvath not with words but with force. He swung his hammer into the broken firmament, cracking the heavens downward. Each strike created a mountain range, jagged and furious, meant to anchor existence against Korvath’s chaos.

Korvath retaliated by carving the first oceans with storms so powerful they sheared through reality, pulling the waters of the astral deep into the forming world.

Their blows reshaped everything.

- Mountains rose where Toruun’s hammer landed.
    
- Trenches and seas opened wherever Korvath’s storms tore the veil.
    
- Sparks of creation rained like falling stars.
    

It was during this cosmic reshaping that **[[Sarynth the Embermother]]**, drawn by the heat, awakened. Her fire filled the fractures of the world, birthing the first volcanoes. The greatest among them — **[[Mount Sarynth]]** — erupted the moment she arrived, a declaration of her claim.

Her flames only escalated the conflict.

---

## **III. The Birth of New Gods**

The more the gods fought, the more their own emotions leaked into creation. Divine essence sparked spontaneously, forming new gods from raw feeling and stray thought.

When a single tear of frustration fell from Korvath’s eye, it crystallized into **[[Merethyn]]**, goddess of tides and sorrow. Her grief gave water purpose, her compassion softened the edges of storms — though she could not turn her father from war.

When Toruun struck the firmament again and again, lightning followed his hammer, igniting the earth below. From that storm, **Hephaestus** brought forth **the twins**, their birth sparked into being by the lightning's heat and force:

- **[[Grondar]]**, born of the stone’s resistance — the relentless hunter, carved from the broken earth.
    
- **[[Lysdara]]**, born of the lightning’s reflection — the goddess of light, clarity, and celestial balance.
    

As more blows fell, more sparks became beings — **countless [[Demi-Gods]]**, each embodying some fleeting need or desire of their creators:

- Tempest-spirits for Korvath
    
- Iron-born wardens for Toruun
    
- Flame sprites for Sarynth
    
- Tidecallers for Merethyn
    

They quarreled. They fought. They rebelled.

The war expanded.

## **IV. The Volcano of Betrayal**

When the first pantheon divided, the firmament could no longer withstand their conflict.

In secret, a god whose name is now erased — the **[[Forgotten God]]** — sought dominion over all creation. He was not the strongest, but he was the most cunning.

He attempted to harness the wounds in the heavens for forbidden power.

He tore a rift into the infernal void.

The tear did not close.

Instead, it bled corruption — poison that dripped into newborn Freyenda, staining it for ages to come. From this wound, infernal energy spilled like blood into the world, seeding a lineage that would one day become the **Tieflings**.

This betrayal shattered any hope of unity.

The war erupted into open chaos.

---

## **V. The Turning of the Embermother**

Seeing creation on the brink of collapse, **Sarynth** withdrew her flames from Korvath’s cause. Fire had shaped the world, but too much fire would end it.

Instead, she turned her power toward forging stability. She anchored the molten core of Freyenda, binding it with chains of living magma. This act enraged Korvath, who saw it as an attempt to “freeze” the world into stillness.

Thus began the first god-war within the god-war.

Storm vs Fire.  
Sea vs Mountain.  
Tears vs Trenches.

Creation trembled under their fury.

---

## **VI. The Rift Endures**

As the chaos peaked, the gods realized the wound torn by the **[[Forgotten God]]** would not heal. The rift bled corruption into the newborn world, and no single deity could close it without unraveling creation itself.

In the war's final days, the pantheon bound the breach with layered wards and oaths, and the Forgotten God's name was struck from divine record. The sky kept the scar; the world kept the poison.

The rift did not end the war, but it changed it. From that moment on, every blow threatened not just a rival god, but the fragile world beneath them.

---

## **VII. The Final Blow ??" and the Shattering**
 The Final Blow — and the Shattering**

With the heavens cracking and the rift bound only by fragile seals, the remaining gods saw the truth:

If the war continued, the world would not survive.

Toruun delivered the last blow of the war — not to a god, but to the heavens themselves.

He shattered the firmament _intentionally_.

Fragments of the sky fell as stars.  
Two large pieces became the moons **Ixor** and **Olmos**.  
Freyenda stabilized beneath the debris.

The war was over.

But none of the gods were victorious.

---

## **VIII. The Withdrawal of the Gods**

Exhausted, wounded, and ashamed, the gods withdrew from the world they had nearly destroyed.

- Korvath retreated to the storm-veiled heights beyond mortal sight.
    
- Toruun wandered the deep stone halls of creation.
    
- Sarynth burrowed into the volcanic heart of the world.
    
- Merethyn returned to her sorrowful seas.
    
- Grondar and Lysdara vanished into myth, their twin lights flickering across the polar skies.
    
- The Forgotten God became nameless, erased from divine memory.
    

Somnurex had not yet awakened; his name would rise later among the Takarians beneath Lumenfell.

And thus began the Age of Mortals.

The gods had forged Freyenda…  
but it was mortals who would inherit it.
