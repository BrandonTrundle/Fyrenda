Somnurex first awoke when Freyenda was still young, when stone was newly split and the world still rang with the echoes of creation. His consciousness was stirred not by prayer, but by labor—the rhythmic thunder of hammers striking deep within the mines of the [[Lumenfell Mountain Range]]. The [[The First Takarians]] were the first to call him forth, though they did not know his name. Their craft, their persistence, and their reverence for the act of making itself became the first hymn ever sung to him. As word spread and settlements rose, the sound of industry carried across Freyenda, and Somnurex awakened fully, born of effort rather than dominion.

The other [[Freyenda Pantheon Structure|gods of Freyenda]] soon took notice of this rising presence. Somnurex did not demand worship nor impose law; instead, he listened. He rewarded ingenuity, patience, and devotion to craft, and mortals flourished under his quiet guidance. Among the gods, his ideas were initially welcomed, even admired. None watched him more closely than [[Lysdara|Lysdara the goddess of light and reflection, twin of Grondar and daughter of Hephaestus]], who saw in him both brilliance and depth. Where her domain revealed, his refined. Where she reflected, he forged. In time, admiration turned to affection, and affection to love.

For centuries, Somnurex and Lysdara were inseparable. Their temples were joined, their followers shared rites, and their domains overlapped in harmony. Yet as the ages passed, Somnurex continued to grow—not through conquest, but through the ever-expanding works of mortals. This slow, inexorable ascent unsettled the pantheon. Lysdara herself began to feel unease, whispers of doubt creeping into her thoughts. Though Somnurex remained faithful, other goddesses were drawn to his presence, mistaking his gravity for invitation. Doubt took root, and doubt became fear.

Troubled and uncertain, Lysdara sought counsel from her father, [[Hephaestus]]. She spoke of Somnurex’s growing influence, of her belief—whether planted by others or born of insecurity—that he had betrayed her. Hephaestus, ever protective, did not question her fears. With his blessing, Lysdara gathered her followers, and the alliances of the gods shifted. What began as concern hardened into resolve. War was declared, not in hatred, but in desperate fear of what Somnurex might one day become.

The war that followed was not merely fought—it was felt. In myth and omen, in dreams and broken rituals, its echoes rippled through Freyenda. Though the heavens burned with conflict, Somnurex never turned his full wrath upon Lysdara. Even as he endured betrayal and assault, his love for her remained unchanged. He sought only to end the war, to preserve what once was. In time, his strength nearly overcame the combined forces arrayed against him, and the gods began to falter.

In secret, Lysdara enacted her final plan. Drawing upon the faith of her worshippers, she created [[The Staff of Lysdara]], an artifact capable of forcing even a god into slumber. She arranged to meet Somnurex within the [[Lumenfell Mountain Range]], on ground shaped by his own hand. There, she feigned remorse and reconciliation, and in the moment he lowered his guard, she struck. The staff shattered his waking will, casting him into a dreaming sleep, and was itself broken into eight pieces by the force of its use. Somnurex was sealed beneath the mountain, dreaming still, and thus earned his final title—the God of Slumber. In the ages since, he has been largely forgotten, remembered only by a scattered few, while his dreams continue to stir quietly beneath Freyenda’s stone.

Beneath the [[Lumenfell Mountain Range]], where stone still remembers the sound of hammers, Somnurex sleeps—and dreams. When [[Lysdara]] sealed him away, the act tore a wound in reality. From that wound bloomed [[Drataria]], a dream-plane shaped entirely by Somnurex’s unconscious mind. It is a vast, merciless desert where heat shimmers like mirages and the sky fractures between memory and nightmare. Every grain of sand is born from thought, every horizon an echo of betrayal. Somnurex does not merely dream there; he _creates_, even in slumber.

During the final days of the divine war, the [[The First Takarians]] fled deep into the mountains as Lysdara’s forces invaded their carved halls. Desperate and devoted, they enacted a forbidden ritual beneath the mountain, seeking salvation through their god. Instead, they were pulled through the forming rift and vanished from Freyenda entirely. To the world above, they were lost—swallowed by stone, erased by myth. In truth, they were drawn into Drataria, where Somnurex’s dreams reshaped them over centuries of unending night.

Within Drataria, the Takarians endured. Their faith did not fade, but it _changed_. Prolonged exposure to Somnurex’s dreaming essence warped their bodies and spirits. Some completed the transformation, becoming full Yuan-Ti—serpentine, alien, and utterly bound to the god of slumber. Others bear only partial signs: scaled skin, slit pupils, whispered instincts they do not fully understand. These beings remember Freyenda as a half-forgotten dream, and many no longer distinguish between waking loyalty and dream-induced devotion.

In the material plane, the age of endless night has stirred old fears and older beliefs. Modern Cultists of Somnurex have grown bolder, convinced that the darkness is an omen of his imminent return. They know nothing of Drataria, nor of the fate of the Ancient Takarians. To them, the past is myth and prophecy, not history. They believe Somnurex was unjustly betrayed and that awakening him will restore balance to a broken world. They do not understand what kind of god now sleeps beneath the mountain.

Unseen by mortals, Lysdara is aware of the cult’s rise—and powerless to stop it directly. The fragments of [[The Staff of Lysdara]], shattered into eight pieces and scattered across Freyenda and other planes, still bind Somnurex’s slumber. Each fragment acts as a distant anchor, maintaining the seal through divine absence rather than strength.

Centuries later, during the Underdark War, **Valla Rynn** carried one such shard into the deepest vaults of Lumenfell. She reached the chamber where Somnurex lay sealed and saw it with her own eyes. The shard trembled, the wards buckled, and the seal cracked just enough for Somnurex's consciousness to seep into the world. The endless night began there, born of a god half-awake and watching. In that same descent, Valla's closest companion was killed, and the blood spilled at the threshold fed the stirrings below, deepening the crack she had unwittingly opened. Lysdara cannot reclaim them herself, nor can she strike at her former lover again without unraveling the fragile order she preserved at such terrible cost.

When Somnurex awakens, he will not rise as he once was. Centuries of dreaming have festered into resentment, and love has curdled into obsession. He will remember Lysdara’s betrayal with perfect clarity, and he will see the material plane not as a home—but as a battlefield that allowed his fall. Drataria will bleed into reality, nightmares will walk beneath the endless night, and Somnurex will seek vengeance not only upon Lysdara, but upon the world that forgot him while he dreamed.
