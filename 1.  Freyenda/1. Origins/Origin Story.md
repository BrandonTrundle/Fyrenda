## **The Birth of Freyenda**

Freyenda was created by the [[Freyenda Pantheon Structure|Gods]] in an age so ancient that even the immortals speak of it in whispers. Before mortal memory, before sky or sea had names, the heavens erupted in a vast and violent conflict known as the **[[War of the Shattered Firmament]]**. Each deity sought dominion over creation, and in their struggle, entire realms were torn apart and reforged like molten metal.

When the war finally waned, the surviving gods shaped what remained of the broken firmament into a new world. Mountains formed where divine weapons struck the earth. Forests grew from the ashes of defeated celestial-beasts. Rivers carved paths along the scars left by falling stars. Every part of Freyenda bears the signature of the god who claimed it.

The heavens themselves still carry the wounds of that battle. Freyenda has two moons — **[[Ixor]]** and **[[Olmos]]** — believed to be the remnants of divine citadels shattered during the war. Some gods even claimed constellations as their personal domains, weaving legends into the night sky.

Freyenda was not simply _made_. It was **forged** in conflict, **claimed** in triumph, and **remembered** in the stars.

## **The Arrival of Mortals**

### **The First Humans**

When the divine war quieted, the world lay still for a time. Then, without warning or omen, the first [[Humans of Freyenda]] appeared. Whether shaped intentionally or sprung from the lingering energies of creation, even the gods do not say.

They emerged in the central plains and riverlands, where the land was fertile and forgiving. Humans were the first to build homes, plant crops, and name the world around them. Their early songs speak of “voices in the wind” that guided them — guidance many scholars today attribute to subtle divine influence.

Humans spread quickly. Their adaptability and ambition made them the first great stewards of Freyenda.

### **The Coming of the Elves**

Not long after humanity spread across the heartlands, sleek ships with curved silver sails appeared on the horizon of the [[Shining Sea]]. From them stepped the first [[Elves of Freyenda]] — refugees, explorers, or exiles, depending on which elven lineage tells the tale.

The elves were captivated by Freyenda’s untouched magic. Though few records remain from that era, most modern historians agree that the early elven tribes wandered far and wide, seeking places whose energies resonated with their own.

Over centuries, this wandering led to divergence. The elves who embraced coastal arcana, those who vanished into deep forests, and those who chased starlight across mountains all evolved into the distinct elven cultures known today.

Thus began the **Age of Kindred**, when humans and elves lived side by side in wary but curious coexistence.

### **The Children of Stone: Gnomes & Dwarves**

As surface civilizations expanded, tremors shook the northern ranges, and the earth cracked open. From the deep places emerged the first [[Freyendan Dwarves]] and [[Freyendan Gnomes]]. Their own histories claim they did not _appear_ but were **awakened** by the world itself.

Dwarves say they were formed from the bones of the mountains.  
Gnomes say they were carved from the sparks of the earth’s hidden fires.

In truth, no one knows. What is certain is that both peoples emerged with an innate connection to stone, metal, and subterranean magic. They settled the high crags and deep caverns, becoming masters of craft long before surface-folk learned the hammer’s rhythm.

### **The Hobbitfolk**

Last of the major mortal races to appear were the [[Hobbits of Freyenda]]. Unlike the others, their origins are shrouded in peaceful mystery. Hobbits did not arrive by ship or rise from the earth — they simply **“began to be”** in the gentle hills and quiet valleys of the south.

No myths describe their creation. No gods claim them. No ancient songs mention a great arrival.

Some scholars theorize they were shaped from the world’s first moments of calm, when creation finally exhaled after ages of cosmic violence. Others believe hobbits are the children of a forgotten minor deity of peace and hearth.

Whatever their origin, hobbits quickly became known as stabilizers of their communities — farmers, storytellers, gardeners, and quiet observers who preferred a life of content simplicity over epic ambition.

### **The Luxodons**

The [[Luxodons of Freyenda]] trace their origin to the southern continent, where the god **Toruun**, the Shaper of Strength and Memory, planted his great iron staff into the earth during the War of the Shattered Firmament.

Where the staff struck, the land rose into massive stone plateaus, and from that stone emerged the first Luxodons — tall, patient giants carved with the same deliberate hand used to sculpt the mountains.

Luxodons were created to be **record-keepers of the gods**, but when the great war ended, the gods withdrew and Luxodons kept recording anyway. Their stonework cities are filled with murals chronicling eras even elves have forgotten.

Luxodons are honored as peacemakers, though their memories hold many secrets they refuse to share.

---

### **The Dragonborn**

When two rival dragon gods — [[Sarynth the Embermother]] and [[Korvath the Storm-Eater]] — clashed during the celestial war, shards of their divine scales fell upon Freyenda.

Where those scales landed, the ground cracked open, and the first [[Dragonborn of Freyenda]] emerged. Each lineage carries a reflection of the original draconic powers shattered in the heavens:

- Fireborn trace to Sarynth
    
- Stormborn to Korvath
    
- Stoneborn to the earth where fragments cooled
    
- Frostborn to the icy north where sparks dimmed
    

Dragonborn see themselves as children of conflict, born from divine shrapnel.

### **Tieflings**

The [[Tieflings of Freyenda]] did _not_ descend from demons — not originally.  
During the War of the Shattered Firmament, **[[Zo'ingal]]** sought forbidden power by opening a rent in the heavens.

The rent never fully closed. Even today, it bleeds a faint residue of infernal energy into Freyenda.

Tieflings began appearing generations later, born to ordinary parents but marked by the lingering corruption of that ancient wound. They are living echoes of divine hubris.

Tieflings often form secret societies dedicated to discovering the full truth of Zo'ingal's motives and legacy.

---

### **Aasimar**

Where the Tieflings are scars of the forgotten god’s ambition, the [[Aasimar of Freyenda]] are sparks of surviving divine power.

After the gods retreated from Freyenda, they left behind _watchers_ — fragments of their essence meant to guide mortals. Most of these fragments took the form of:

- Starlight
    
- Sacred fire
    
- Moonlit visions
    
- Dreams carried on wind
    

Occasionally, a mortal child was born touched by one of these fragments, becoming an Aasimar.

Every Aasimar lineage is unknowingly tied to a different deity’s lingering watchfulness.

### **Orcs**

In the far north, where the mountains were torn apart during the divine war, the god [[Grondar the Relentless Hunt]] shaped the first [[Orcs of Freyenda]] from fragments of broken stone and the breath of winter storms.

Orcs rose as guardians of the frontier — hunters, raiders, wardens — and originally served as the mountain’s protectors against intrusions from the spirit world.

Their ancient duty has mostly been forgotten by outsiders, but many orc clans still speak of the [[Old Hunt]], a threat that will one day return from beyond the northern peaks.

---

### **Half-Orcs**

Half-orcs appeared as bridges between cultures, not as accidents.  
Old tradition says that when the first humans began expanding into the far north, the spirits of the land demanded unity between the two strongest peoples.

The first half-orcs were born to formal alliances between orc warleaders and human travelers who sought safe passage.

Over time, half-orcs became known as **the Folk of Two Worlds**, with an uncanny ability to cross boundaries — cultural, magical, and political.

---

### **Firbolgs**

The [[Firbolg of Freyenda]] claim they were the last children created by the goddess of growth and decay, [[Eronwe]], before she withdrew from the world in mourning.

Firbolgs emerged from the deepest forests, shaped from bark, root, and dreamlike spirit-stuff. They are natural guardians, gentle until provoked, and possess an instinctive bond to ancient, pre-divine natural magic.

Many Firbolg traditions speak of  “[[Inowyn the First Garden]],” a paradise that once existed before Freyenda took form — and which they believe still sleeps under layers of time.

---

### **Tabaxi**

The [[Tabaxi of Freyenda]] were created when the trickster god **[[Felari]]** danced across the southern jungles in celebration of the war’s end.

Where his paws touched the earth, trees sprouted in spirals, and bursts of starlight condensed into curious, feline hunters. Tabaxi inherited Felari’s boundless curiosity and his love for stories.

Because they originated from divine celebration rather than divine conflict, Tabaxi view the world differently: not as a battlefield, but as an endless story waiting to be explored.

---

### **Lizardfolk**

In the marshlands of the southeast, the god **[[Vekal the Deep Current]]** submerged himself beneath the waters after the divine war, exhausted and wounded.

From his cast-off scales grew the first [[Lizardfolk of Freyenda]].  
They are pragmatic, instinct-driven, and view life as a cycle of survival rather than destiny.

Lizardfolk oral tradition claims Vekal still sleeps beneath the [[Vekalian Marsh]] — and that one day, he will rise when the waters turn black with prophecy.

---

### **Tritons**

The [[Tritons of Freyenda]] claim descent from those who followed a goddess of tides and storms, **[[Merethyn]]**, when she retreated from the shattered heavens.

Diving into the deepest parts of the [[Shining Sea]], she reshaped her followers into sea-dwellers, giving them guardianship over underwater rifts left behind by the celestial war.

Tritons consider themselves custodians of the ocean’s wounds — and they view surface conflicts as petty in comparison.
