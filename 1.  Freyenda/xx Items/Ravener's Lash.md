## **Description**

A segmented whip forged from shadow-touched adamantine, each link shaped like a jagged fang. Purple runes pulse faintly along its length, and a whispering voice echoes from it when drawn. The handle is wrapped in supple black leather that subtly shifts to match its wielder’s grip.

## **Lore**

Forged by a cabal of exiled warlocks, this whip houses the essence of a slain shadow demon. It whispers promises of power to its wielder, twisting ambition toward cruelty.  
Legends claim its last owner slaughtered an entire cult to quiet its hunger—only for the weapon to awaken again when peace took root.
