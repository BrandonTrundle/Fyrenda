# **Port Gloamreach**

Port Gloamreach is Dalir's eastern harbor on the [[Twilight Ocean]]. It launches the city\'s finest hulls and handles high value trade. The harbor is built with steep stone breakwaters and a long line of signal towers to pierce the ocean fog. Current unrest comes from suspected tariff skimming and berth favors tied to [[Mavrik "Salt-Hand" Caim]].
