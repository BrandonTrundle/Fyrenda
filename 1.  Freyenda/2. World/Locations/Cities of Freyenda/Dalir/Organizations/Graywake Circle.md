# **Graywake Circle**

The Graywake Circle is Dalir's most prominent thieves guild. Its members handle smuggling, forgery, and dockside protection rackets, keeping their influence hidden behind legitimate cargo operations. The Circle prefers quiet leverage over open violence, and its symbol is a fog-gray ring stamped on a sealed crate.
