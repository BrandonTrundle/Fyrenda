# **Highwall Ring**

Highwall Ring is Dalir's outer bastion district and the first line of defense against the Twilight Ocean. Massive sea-facing walls, signal-fires, and watchtowers define the skyline. The [[King Harlon Ironcrown|King's Hold]] sits here, along with the quiet [[Sanctum of Toruun]].
