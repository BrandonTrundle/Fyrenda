The **Lumenfell Mountain Range** rises like a jagged spine through the heart of Freyenda, its peaks veined with a radiant mineral known as **Lumenfell Ore**. Long before written history, this ore shaped the destiny of the region. It hums faintly when exposed, resonating with arcane energy, and has become the foundation of countless magical contraptions, engines, and defensive works throughout Freyenda. Entire industries were built around its extraction, and the mountains themselves seem alive with power, as though the stone remembers the god sleeping beneath it.

Carved directly into these mountains stands **[[Takari]]**, a city of terraces, tunnels, and monumental halls. The earliest Takarians did not build _upon_ the mountain—they built _within_ it, shaping stone as an act of reverence. Over centuries, Takari grew upward as much as inward, its modern districts layered atop the bones of an ancient civilization. Much of Old Takari lies sealed or forgotten, buried behind collapsed tunnels and forbidden gates, though fragments of that age still endure in hidden vaults and abandoned corridors.

The most imposing remnant of that era is the **[[Obelisk of Durak]]**, a colossal stone monolith that pierces through multiple layers of the city. Named for **Durak Takari**, son of the city’s original founder, the obelisk was both a monument and a ward. Its surface is etched with worn runes and geometric reliefs that glow faintly when Lumenfell Ore is active nearby. Scholars debate its true purpose—some claim it stabilized the mountain, others that it served as a focus for divine energies—but all agree it predates the sealing of Somnurex.

Deep beneath the oldest levels of Takari lies the true heart of the mountain, a region untouched by modern hands. Here, the stone grows warm and smooth, shaped not by tools but by divine presence. This is **Somnurex’s resting place**, sealed far below the surface after his betrayal by Lysdara. The air is heavy with drowsiness, and those who linger too long report vivid dreams, lost memories, and the sensation of being watched by something vast and patient. The boundary between waking thought and dream thins with every step downward.

It was in these depths that the final catastrophe of the Ancient Takarians occurred. As Lysdara sealed Somnurex, a portal tore open beneath the mountain, drawing the faithful into **[[Drataria]]**, the god’s dream-plane. The chamber where this occurred still exists—collapsed, warded, and feared. Ancient mechanisms and ritual markings remain, half-fused into the rock, as if reality itself recoiled from what happened there. Few who reach this place return unchanged, and none have fully mapped its depths.

Adding to the mountain’s danger is a **direct passage to the [[Underdark]]**, hidden within a labyrinth of natural caverns and abandoned mining tunnels. This route predates Takari itself and was likely known only to the earliest settlers. Creatures from below occasionally surface through forgotten shafts, and rumors persist of Underdark factions seeking Lumenfell Ore for their own designs. Between the sleeping god, the dream-plane scar, and the world beneath the world, the Lumenfell Mountain Range stands as one of the most dangerous—and most important—locations in all of Freyenda.
