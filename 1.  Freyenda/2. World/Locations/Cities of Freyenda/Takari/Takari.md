# **Takari — The Jewel of the North**

Takari, known throughout Freyenda as **the Jewel of the North**, stands as one of the largest and most prosperous mountain cities ever carved by mortal hands. Nestled deep within the Lumenfell Mountain Range, the city is as old as the earliest ages of settlement and carries a history layered with ambition, catastrophe, and stubborn survival.

Takari was not built upon the land—it was **cut from it**. Its streets, terraces, and halls were carved directly into the mountain’s living stone, rising atop the ruins of the **Ancient Takarian City**, a civilization that vanished without warning or trace. Though centuries have passed, fragments of that ancient age still remain beneath the modern streets, silent and sealed, their purpose forgotten but their presence undeniable.

At the city’s heart stands the **Monument of Durak Takari**, a towering obelisk left behind by the ancient settlers. It rises through the city’s layers like a stone spine, a reminder that Takari was founded not merely as a refuge, but as a statement—one meant to endure.

# **The Three Wards of Takari**

Takari is divided into **three ascending terraces**, each carved into the mountainside and shaped by a different relationship with labor, power, and legacy:

1. [[The Lower Ward]]
    
2. [[The Middle Ward]]
    
3. [[The Upper Ward]]
    

These wards represent more than elevation. Each reflects a distinct way of life, a different interpretation of what it means to survive—and succeed—within the mountain.

# **The Lower Ward**

The **Lower Ward** is the industrial foundation of Takari. It houses the primary entrances to the Lumenfell Mines, the city’s forges and smelters, and the dense residential blocks of miners, smiths, and laborers whose work sustains the city above.

This ward runs on mutual reliance rather than authority. Neighbors depend on one another more than on the Takarian Guard, and heavy-handed oversight has historically led to unrest. One such confrontation escalated into a strike that ultimately gave rise to the **Takarian Laborers Union**, a force the Council now treats with caution and respect.

Despite lingering resentment toward authority, the Lower Ward understands the necessity of protection. With renewed Underdark activity threatening the mountain’s depths, increased guard presence is tolerated—if not welcomed—by those who remember the cost of unguarded tunnels.

The Lower Ward is defined by heat and motion. Forges burn day and night. Steam rises from smelter blocks. Hammers strike steel in steady rhythm, and sparks leap through darkened alleys like fireflies. The air carries the scent of coal, metal, and stone, softened in residential pockets by the smell of home-cooked meals and spiced stews.

Here, Lumenfell stone is refined into **Lumenfell Ore**, a rare and powerful metal believed by many artisans to carry the essence of Toruun himself. Its forging is treated not merely as labor, but as sacred craft. Festivals honoring forge gods and labor traditions remain common, reinforcing a belief deeply rooted in the ward: **hard work earns elevation**.

For some, that belief becomes reality. For others, the Lower Ward’s blazing forges and unbreakable community are enough. Here, labor is not just survival—it is identity.

# **The Middle Ward**

**[[The Middle Ward]]** forms Takari’s economic backbone, bridging the raw industry of the Lower Ward with the political authority of the Upper. It is the realm of merchants, traders, shopkeepers, and foremen—many of whom began their lives below and worked their way upward through discipline and ambition.

This ward is where labor becomes product and product becomes profit. Raw materials from the mines are refined, cataloged, sold, and shipped beyond the mountain. Trade houses, storefronts, and counting halls dominate the streets, and the city’s wealth changes hands here more than anywhere else.

One of the most influential figures in the ward is Leedra Vance, whose operations through Vance Industries shape trade routes far beyond Takari itself. Her presence is felt in contracts, caravans, and council debates alike.

Most travelers entering Takari are funneled directly into the Middle Ward via the Old Takarian Way, an ancient stone road carved by the city’s first settlers. As a result, this terrace serves as Takari’s public face—the place where visitors first experience the city’s scale, discipline, and prosperity.

Markets fill broad plazas with metalwork, tools, spices, cloth, jewelry, and exotic goods from distant regions. Entertainers perform in open spaces, transforming busy intersections into spontaneous gatherings. Compared to the relentless grind of the Lower Ward, the Middle Ward feels lighter—less smoke, fewer forges, more conversation and coin.

Here, success is measured differently. Efficiency, negotiation, and influence matter more than endurance. Some residents view the Middle Ward as a stepping stone toward power in the Upper Ward. Others find it the perfect balance: far enough from the heat to breathe, close enough to remain part of the city’s pulse.

# **The Upper Ward**

**[[The Upper Ward]]** crowns Takari both physically and politically. Carved into the mountain’s upper face, it is the seat of governance, authority, and long-standing influence. Pale stone structures gleam under lanternlight and moonlight, their polished surfaces reflecting a city determined to remain vigilant against the darkness below.

Ascending from the Middle Ward into the Upper often feels like crossing into a different world. The streets grow quieter. The air colder. The scrutiny sharper.

At the center of the ward stands the **Mayoral Manor**, home to Takari’s leadership and the symbol of its fragile stability. Within lies the **Inner Sanctum**, the council chamber where the city’s future is argued beneath heavy curtains and warm braziers. The massive circular table at its heart—carved with ancient motifs—feels older than the room itself, a reminder that Takari’s governance rests atop layers of forgotten history.

Life in the Upper Ward offers comfort and security unmatched elsewhere in the city: private courtyards, lantern-lit walkways, guarded residences, and access to libraries and archives preserving centuries of record. But privilege carries pressure. Reputation, alliances, and political consequence shape daily life here as surely as stone shapes the city below.

The ward’s lanterns burn brighter than any others, a deliberate effort to push back the endless night that cloaks Takari. To some, this is a symbol of hope. To others, it is proof of fear—fear of what waits beneath the mountain, and of what might rise if vigilance falters.

Residents of the Upper Ward typically serve as civic leaders, political patrons, or high-ranking officials within the guard. They do not see Takari merely as a home, but as a responsibility—a legacy carved by those who came before, and one that must not be allowed to fail.
