The **[[The First Takarians]]** were the original inhabitants of the [[Lumenfell Mountain Range]], a people defined not by conquest or empire, but by creation. They carved their homes directly into the living stone, believing that shaping the mountain was a sacred act rather than a defiance of nature. To them, labor was prayer, endurance was devotion, and craft was communion. Their society formed around quarries, forges, and deep halls where the rhythm of hammer on stone echoed endlessly through the mountain’s heart.

It was through this relentless industry that they unknowingly awakened **[[Somnurex]]**. Long before temples bore his name, the Takarians felt his presence in moments of inspiration and exhaustion alike. Tools held longer, stone split cleaner, and designs came unbidden in dreams. When Somnurex revealed himself, he did not demand obedience—he simply _remained_. The Takarians became his first worshippers not through fear, but through recognition. They saw in him the embodiment of the struggle they already revered.

As Somnurex grew in power, so too did Takari. The city expanded downward and outward, becoming a marvel of stonecraft and arcane engineering fueled by **Lumenfell Ore**. The Takarians’ faith shaped their governance, their rituals, and their architecture. Great works were raised not to glorify rulers, but to honor perseverance. Among these creations stood the **[[Obelisk of Durak]]**, erected during the height of their civilization as both a monument and a stabilizing anchor within the mountain—a silent testament to their belief that structure and balance could endure any age.

When war erupted between Somnurex and **[[Lysdara]]**, the First Takarians were caught in a conflict far beyond mortal scale. Lysdara’s forces advanced upon Takari, and the mountain city came under siege. Knowing they could not withstand divine war, the Takarians retreated ever deeper into the mountain, toward the sanctum closest to their god. There, surrounded by ancient mechanisms and half-forgotten rites, they prepared a final act of faith.

In desperation, the Takarians performed a ritual meant to preserve Somnurex—or perhaps themselves. They never knew that, at the moment of his sealing, a rift would open beneath the mountain. Instead of salvation, they were drawn into **[[Drataria]]**, the dream-plane born from Somnurex’s slumber. To the world above, they vanished without trace. To history, they became a mystery. Within Drataria, however, they endured, shaped slowly by divine dreams and nightmares alike.

Over centuries in Drataria, the First Takarians were transformed. Their devotion twisted into physical change, many becoming Yuan-Ti, while others bear subtler marks of that evolution. Though they still remember Takari, those memories blur with dream and myth. Some believe they were chosen. Others believe they were abandoned. Yet all remain bound to Somnurex, waiting—consciously or not—for the moment he wakes. When that day comes, the First Takarians will not return as builders of cities, but as relics of a faith that outlived the world that forgot them.
