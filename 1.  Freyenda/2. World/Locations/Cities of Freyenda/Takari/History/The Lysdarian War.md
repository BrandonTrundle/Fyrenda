# The Lysdarian War

A concise history of the conflict in which Lysdara's followers, the Lysdarians, drove the First Takarians into the mountain depths and set the stage for Somnurex's sealing and the loss of ancient Takari.

## Overview

The Lysdarian War was a religious and territorial campaign waged by the followers of **[[Lysdara]]** against the First Takarians of **[[Takari]]**. It did not begin as a conquest of mortals, but as a divine conflict translated into mortal hands. Lysdara's fear of Somnurex's ascent spilled into the world, and her devotees framed the Takarian devotion to the Dream-Forge god as dangerous heresy. What followed was a sustained siege that pushed the First Takarians ever deeper into the Lumenfell Mountain Range.

## Causes

- Somnurex's awakening through Takarian industry shifted the balance of the pantheon.
- Lysdara's followers viewed Takarian faith as the seed of an imbalance that would eclipse her light.
- The First Takarians refused to abandon their god, seeing their craft as sacred and non-negotiable.

## The Lysdarians

The Lysdarians were not a single nation but a coalition of zealots, priest-knights, and allied forces devoted to Lysdara's doctrine of illumination, purity, and reflection. They brought polished steel, ritual light, and mirror-magic into the mountains, believing that the deep places of Lumenfell were a wound that only light could cleanse.

## The War in the Mountain

The conflict unfolded as a long campaign of pressure rather than open-field battles:

- The Lysdarians seized outer ridges and passes, cutting trade and forcing the Takarians inward.
- Lantern rites and mirror wards were raised along the mountain approaches to deny Somnurex's influence.
- The Takarians fortified their halls, carving deeper sanctums and sealing tunnels behind them.
- Skirmishes became ritualized, with Lysdarian commanders declaring the war a "cleansing" while Takarian leaders called it an assault on sacred labor.

## The Descent

As the siege tightened, the First Takarians retreated into their oldest chambers near Somnurex's resting place. The war became a siege of patience: light pressing downward, stone yielding inch by inch. Takarian records describe weeks of dwindling food, broken lift chains, and hymns sung in tunnels no longer touched by daylight.

## The Rite and the Vanishing

At the war's climax, the First Takarians performed a desperate ritual in the deep chambers beneath Lumenfell. The intent was salvation - either to preserve Somnurex or to shelter their people within his protection. The ritual coincided with Lysdara's sealing of Somnurex. The result was catastrophe: the Takarians were pulled into **[[Drataria]]**, and the ancient city above was left empty and silent.

## Aftermath

- The Lysdarians withdrew after the mountain fell silent, interpreting the vanishing as proof of divine judgment.
- Surviving surface settlements reclaimed Takari generations later, unaware of the true cause of the disappearance.
- The war became myth, remembered in fragments as a "war of light" and a "flight into stone."

## Legacy

- Lysdarian iconography persists in Takari as reworked symbols of Se'lune worship.
- The sealed chambers of ancient Takari still bear traces of mirror-wards and light-etchings.
- The conflict seeded the cultural fear of the deep and the belief that light must be maintained at all costs.

## Notes for Play

- Lysdarian relics can appear as mirrors, lenses, or light-warded sigils in sealed halls.
- Surviving records may frame the war as purification, while Takarian accounts frame it as persecution.
- Any rediscovery of Lysdarian truth can destabilize modern faith and politics in Takari.
