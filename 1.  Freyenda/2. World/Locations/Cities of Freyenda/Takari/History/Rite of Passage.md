# The Rite of Passage

An ancient Takarian ritual of survival, devotion, and transition, first performed during the Lysdarian War and later twisted into blood rite by modern cultists.

## Summary

The Rite of Passage is a ceremonial attempt to carry a faithful people through a crisis by anchoring them to Somnurex's protection. It is not a prayer alone, but a constructed passage between states: waking to dreaming, stone to sand, mortal to eternal. In its original form, it was intended to preserve the First Takarians during the siege. In its modern form, it is used to force open the boundary to Drataria.

## Origin

- Created by Durak Takari during the Lysdarian War as the city fell inward and the siege tightened.
- Performed in the deepest chambers of Lumenfell at the moment Lysdara sealed Somnurex.
- The ritual intersected with the sealing and tore open a passage to Drataria, pulling the faithful through.

## Purpose

Original intent:

- Preserve the First Takarians by binding their faith to Somnurex.
- Create a sanctum beyond the reach of Lysdarian forces.

Modern intent (Thorne's version):

- Force open the passage to Drataria.
- Feed Somnurex's stirring with blood and panic.
- Use the ritual as proof that Lysdara's light failed.

## Core Elements

- **Moonstone (refined Lumenfell ore):** stabilizes the ritual geometry, used in pyres, wards, and runes.
- **Blood:** serves as a fuel and anchor, binding the rite to living will.
- **Chant:** a synchronized litany that keeps the passage aligned.
- **Runes and sigils:** carved into the chamber to map the passage.
- **Keys of Balance:** symbolic choices that determine the outcome (Moon and Serpent are the true path; Sun and Forge are rejections).

## Roles Within the Rite

- **Anchor:** the bound figure whose life holds the passage open.
- **Chanter:** leads the litany and keeps the rite synchronized.
- **Gatekeeper:** aligns the sigils and ensures the correct keys are chosen.
- **Bloodbearer:** provides the final offering at the threshold.

## Outcomes

- **Controlled Passage:** the ritual is stabilized; those pulled through arrive intact.
- **Fractured Passage:** the ritual is forced; the passage opens but scatters and mutates those taken.
- **Collapse:** the passage flickers shut, causing backlash and sealing damage.

## Notes for Play

- If the rite is stabilized (pillars active), the passage opens cleanly.
- If destabilized, the passage opens violently and leaves the chamber scarred.
- Thorne's ritual is a corrupted echo of Durak's original design.
