# The Underdark War

A comprehensive account of the conflict that reshaped Takari and set the stage for the endless night.

## Overview

The Underdark War was a sustained series of incursions and sieges that erupted from the sealed depths beneath Takari in DR 1225 and ended in a hard-won victory in DR 1230. It was not a single battle but a grinding campaign of tunnel breaches, guerrilla raids, and desperate counter-offensives. The war forced Takari to reorganize its defenses, elevate Valla Rynn to leadership, and confront the sealed history under the Lumenfell Mountains.

## Timeline

- DR 1225: First major breaches. Darkmantle swarms and chitin-armored raiders emerge through forgotten shafts and ventilation tunnels. Lower Ward suffers heavy losses and supply disruption.
- DR 1226-1227: Skirmish phase. Guard patrols rotate between terraces; multiple shafts are sealed or collapsed to contain spread. Civil unrest rises as mine output falls and trade delays grow.
- DR 1228: Marshal Hadrik Voen is killed in a tunnel ambush. Command fractures; Valla Rynn assumes leadership in the field with Brennor Stoneward as second.
- DR 1229: Counter-offensive phase. Guard reorganizes into rotating strike teams, establishes fortified choke points, and uses controlled collapses to isolate incursion routes.
- DR 1230: Final breach and sealing. Enchanted stone and structural collapse end the major incursion routes. The sitting mayor and the Council's First Speaker die in a tunnel cave-in during evacuation. Valla is confirmed as mayor in the aftermath.

## Causes and Triggers

- The deep seals below Takari were old and strained by centuries of shallow mining and vibration.
- The Underdark forces targeted access routes leading toward sealed chambers and ancient Takarian ruins.
- The city underestimated the coordination and persistence of the interlopers, treating early incursions as isolated incidents.

## Key Factions and Figures

- Takarian Guard: The primary defense force, reorganized during the war into depth-based units and tunnel response teams.
- Brennor Stoneward: Acting commander and tactical stabilizer, responsible for rotations, fallback points, and extraction discipline.
- Valla Rynn: Field leader who reorganized the Guard and later became mayor.
- Underdark Interlopers: A loose convergence of hostile forces using probes, raids, and sabotage to test defenses.
- The Stonebound: Labor culture and tunnel experts who provided crucial knowledge of stress lines and safe collapses.

## Major Theaters

- Lower Ward: Initial breach zone, heavy casualties, and the most sustained fighting.
- Sealed Shafts: A patchwork of abandoned tunnels and collapsed passages that became the main battlefield.
- Choke Points and Fallback Chambers: Fortified tunnel intersections where Valla's teams regrouped and held lines.

## Turning Point

The death of Marshal Hadrik Voen created a command vacuum. Valla Rynn assumed control, implemented rotating strike teams, and established hard fallback positions. With Brennor Stoneward's discipline and logistics, the Guard shifted from reactive defense to controlled counter-offensive operations.

## The Final Seal

In DR 1230, the Guard launched a coordinated push to collapse the most active Underdark routes. Enchanted stone and controlled cave-ins sealed the deepest passages. The operation succeeded, but the cost was severe: the sitting mayor and the Council's First Speaker were killed when an escort tunnel failed.

## The Shard Descent and the Endless Night

During the final year of the war, Valla led a strike into a sealed chamber deep beneath the city and saw the vault where Somnurex lay bound. She carried a shard of Lysdara's staff into the chamber. The shard resonated, the wards buckled, and the seal cracked just enough for Somnurex's consciousness to seep into the world. The endless night began at that moment. Valla's closest companion died in the descent, and the blood spilled at the threshold fed the god's stirring and deepened the fracture.

## Aftermath

- Valla Rynn confirmed as mayor; Brennor Stoneward elevated as the Guard's stabilizing authority.
- City policy shifts toward containment, layered seals, and cautious mining.
- Fear of deep tunnels becomes normalized; sealed gates are guarded and reinforced.
- Dream-fever incidents rise as Somnurex's consciousness bleeds into the waking world.

## Unresolved Threads

- The Underdark interlopers were pushed back, not destroyed; incursions continue at a lower intensity.
- The sealed chamber beneath Lumenfell remains a point of fear and rumor.
- The staff fragments are scattered across the planes; recovery efforts could either reinforce or break the seal.

## Notes for Play

- The war is recent enough to influence veteran NPCs and civic policy.
- Survivors carry trauma, scars, and missing memories tied to dream exposure.
- Any renewed mining push or ritual activity can trigger political conflict and public unrest.
