The **Underdark Interlopers** are not a single army or unified people, but a **loose convergence of hostile forces** drawn upward by weakness in the mountain’s deep seals. Darkmantle swarms, chitin-armored raiders, tunnel-burrowing horrors, and disciplined scouting parties have all been sighted beneath Takari’s lowest reaches. Some are predators following instinct. Others are intelligent actors probing defenses, mapping routes, and testing responses.

These interlopers are not interested in Takari as a city—they are interested in what lies _under_ it. Ancient passages, sealed vaults, forgotten chambers, and the lingering power left behind by the First Takarians make the Lumenfell depths uniquely valuable. To the Underdark, Takari is not a prize to conquer, but a **structure squatting on contested ground**.

Unlike surface threats, Underdark forces operate with patience. Small breaches appear and vanish. Tunnels collapse in places no one remembers opening. Creatures retreat the moment resistance stiffens, only to resurface elsewhere weeks later. This behavior suggests coordination, or at least guidance, from something intelligent enough to avoid open war while weakening the city incrementally.

The Interlopers are keenly aware of Takari’s internal fractures. They exploit labor unrest, sabotage poorly guarded shafts, and retreat whenever Guard patrols grow predictable. Several incidents indicate they have learned the city’s reinforcement patterns—attacking just beyond newly sealed zones, or striking where infrastructure is already strained. Whether this knowledge is earned through observation or assistance from within remains unclear.

The **Underdark War** forced Takari to acknowledge these threats publicly, but it did not eliminate them. It only drove them deeper. Veterans of the Guard know the truth: the war never ended. It **paused**. And the pause grows shorter each year.

### **What the Underdark Interlopers Want**

The Underdark Interlopers want **access and advantage**. They seek to reclaim ancient routes, establish footholds beneath the city, and exploit the instability caused by sealed history, reckless mining, and rising dream-magic. Whether they intend eventual invasion, long-term occupation, or something worse depends on how fractured—and distracted—Takari becomes.
