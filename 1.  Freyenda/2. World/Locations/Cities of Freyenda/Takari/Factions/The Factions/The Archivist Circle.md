The **Archivist Circle** is Takari’s quietest faction—and one of its most dangerous. It has no guards, no banners, and no official authority beyond the [[Lantern Library]]’s walls. Yet its members shape what Takari remembers, what it forgets, and what truths are allowed to survive long enough to become inconvenient. In a city built atop a vanished civilization, memory is power, and the Archivists are its stewards.

The Circle formed during Takari’s rebirth, when scholars realized how much of the city’s past had already been lost—or deliberately erased. Their founding principle was simple and radical: **history must be preserved whole, not curated for comfort**. This belief immediately put them at odds with religious authorities and political leaders who viewed certain truths as destabilizing. The Archivist Circle does not seek to rule Takari—but it refuses to let Takari lie to itself.

Operating primarily out of restricted wings of the Lantern Library, the Circle maintains sealed collections containing pre-collapse records, fragmentary First Takarian inscriptions, untranslated runic plates, and eyewitness accounts deemed “unreliable” by official historians. Access to these archives is tightly controlled, not to hoard knowledge, but to protect it from destruction. Several Circle members believe that ignorance—not heresy—is the greatest threat to the city.

The Circle’s unofficial leader is **[[Julia Bramblewood]]**, an incisive historian whose reputation for blunt honesty has earned her equal parts respect and suspicion. Julia believes Takari’s collapse was not an accident, nor solely divine punishment, but the result of compounded human decisions. She pushes relentlessly to cross-reference myths, mining records, and religious texts, arguing that truth only emerges when disciplines collide. Julia does not fear political backlash—she fears silence.

Where Julia seeks synthesis, **[[Archivist Thoren Pell]]** seeks preservation. An elderly linguist and rune scholar, Thoren specializes in stabilizing decaying inscriptions and reconstructing partially erased texts. He believes Takari is losing history faster than it realizes, not through censorship alone, but through neglect. Thoren has quietly copied entire archives by hand, storing duplicates in undisclosed locations in case the originals are seized or destroyed.

The Circle’s most controversial member is **[[Lysa Merrow]]**, a field historian who insists that archives alone are insufficient. Lysa ventures into sealed tunnels, abandoned chambers, and forgotten districts to document what still exists physically beneath the city. Her reports often contradict accepted timelines and have sparked multiple disputes with the Council and the Lantern Faith. Several of her expeditions ended with missing companions—incidents officially attributed to “structural failure.”

Bridging scholarship and politics is **[[Corin Hale]]**, a former civic scribe who understands how knowledge moves through Takari’s institutions. Corin handles correspondence, petitions, and quiet negotiations to keep the Circle operating legally. He knows which councilors can be pressured, which clerics can be delayed, and which laws can be interpreted loosely enough to buy time. Without Corin, the Circle would have been dissolved years ago.

The Archivist Circle exists in constant tension with nearly every major faction. The Lantern Faith views it as spiritually irresponsible. The Lumenfell Consortium sees it as an obstacle to expansion. Vance Industries considers it an irritant best ignored or discredited. The Collegium treats it with cautious respect, knowing that suppressed history has a habit of resurfacing in arcane disaster. The Circle survives because it does not act loudly—it acts _persistently_.



### **What the Archivist Circle Wants**

The Archivist Circle wants **truth without filtration**. It seeks to uncover what really happened to the First Takarians, to understand the forces beneath the mountain, and to ensure Takari never again mistakes ignorance for safety. They believe the city’s future depends not on what it builds—but on what it is willing to remember, no matter how uncomfortable that memory becomes.
