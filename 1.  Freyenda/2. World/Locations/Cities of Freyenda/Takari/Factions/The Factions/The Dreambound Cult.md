The **Dreambound** are not a cult in the traditional sense—they have no banners, no temples, and no centralized leadership. They are a **network of believers, sleepers, and listeners** bound together by shared dreams rather than doctrine. In Takari, they exist in whispers: dockworkers who don’t sleep, scholars who record visions they shouldn’t remember, miners who wake knowing tunnels they’ve never walked. To the city at large, the Dreambound are a rumor. To those who’ve felt the pull of the deep dreaming, they are proof that **something beneath the mountain is still aware**.

The Dreambound believe that Takari’s endless night is not a curse, but a symptom. In their view, Somnurex never truly slept—he _dreamed_, and those dreams leaked into the stone. The First Takarians did not vanish; they transitioned. Drataria, the dream-plane born of Somnurex’s slumber, is not exile but preservation. The Dreambound see themselves as inheritors of that unfinished ritual, fragments of a lineage that was interrupted, not erased.

Their gatherings are small and deliberately unstructured. Meetings occur in basements, sealed storage chambers, abandoned tunnels, and private homes where Moonstone lanterns are dimmed or removed entirely. They share dreams, compare symbols, and map recurring visions: deserts of glass, serpents carved from light, hammers striking without sound. The Dreambound do not summon or command—they **attune**. Most members do not even realize they belong to the faction until someone else recognizes the same dream in them.

The most widely known Dreambound figure is **[[Elyndra Vesh]]**, a former Collegium student expelled after publishing a thesis on shared dream resonance beneath Takari. Elyndra believes dreams are not personal experiences, but _locations_—places the mind travels when barriers thin. She acts as a quiet organizer, helping Dreambound recognize one another and avoid Lantern Faith scrutiny. She is careful, intelligent, and utterly convinced that awakening Somnurex is inevitable.

More dangerous is **[[Carthos Rel]]**, a charismatic labor foreman in the Lower Ward who claims to receive _instructions_ in his sleep. Carthos believes the Dreambound must act, not merely observe. He pushes for deeper rituals, bolder experimentation, and deliberate attempts to breach sealed zones. Several unexplained tunnel incidents trace back to areas under his influence, though nothing has ever been proven. To Carthos, caution is betrayal.

Serving as the Dreambound’s anchor to the past is **[[Sivra Coilborn]]**, a woman whose bloodline shows faint yuan-ti traits—scaled patches along the neck, slit pupils in low light. Sivra claims her ancestors were among the First Takarians pulled into Drataria, altered but not destroyed. She remembers things she has never been taught and draws maps that disturb both Archivists and engineers. Whether Sivra is a prophet, a survivor, or something else entirely is unclear.

The Dreambound are hunted quietly. The Lantern Faith monitors them aggressively, labeling them spiritually compromised. The Council dismisses them as fringe mystics. The Collegium fears them as uncontrolled variables. Dekra Billinger considers them _evidence_—dangerous, unreliable, but impossible to ignore. For every Dreambound member discovered, three more remain unseen.

### **What the Dreambound Want**

The Dreambound want **awakening through understanding**. They believe Somnurex will rise whether Takari prepares or not, and that those who listen now will survive what comes after. Some want communion. Some want power. A few want revenge for a history buried in stone. What unites them is the certainty that the city is standing on a dream that is close to ending—and that when it does, only those who learned to dream with it will endure.
