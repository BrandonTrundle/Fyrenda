The **Lantern Faith** is the dominant religious force in Takari, outwardly devoted to protection, vigilance, and the belief that light keeps the city safe. Its symbols are everywhere—Moonstone lanterns above doorways, cleansing rites in public squares, prayers whispered before sleep. To the average citizen, the Faith is comfort made ritual: a promise that the darkness beneath the mountain can be held at bay if watched closely enough.

Publicly, the Lantern Faith teaches discipline and unity. Darkness is framed not as evil, but as a condition that must be _managed_. Light is order. Light is safety. Light is control. The clergy presents itself as a stabilizing presence, working alongside the Council and Guard to maintain morale during endless night and recurring tremors. Their sermons emphasize vigilance, obedience, and the dangers of forgotten paths.

Privately, the Faith is far more anxious than it appears. Senior clergy are keenly aware that the city rests atop older beliefs they do not fully understand—and cannot fully erase. Pre-collapse shrines were converted, defaced, or sealed, but traces remain. Symbols resurface in dreams. Old prayers slip into modern hymns. The Lantern Faith does not merely oppose other beliefs; it works to **overwrite them**.

At the head of the Faith in Takari stands **[[Father Thorne]]**, a man whose authority derives as much from certainty as from doctrine. Thorne believes Takari’s suffering is the result of spiritual neglect and that fear is a useful corrective. His sermons are long, forceful, and unapologetically judgmental. He does not hide his disdain for ambiguity—especially arcane ambiguity—and he views dissent as weakness. To Thorne, order must be enforced before it can be believed.

Supporting him is **[[Sister Elain Morwyn]]**, caretaker of public rites and the Faith’s most visible presence among the people. Elain is calm, empathetic, and beloved in the lower and middle wards. She tends to the sick, oversees lantern blessings, and offers solace to those plagued by nightmares. Many citizens trust her more than they trust the Council. Elain believes sincerely in the Faith’s mission—but she quietly fears that the light she offers is thinning.

Within the Faith’s inner circle operates **[[High Luminant Kessra Vael]]**, an austere scholar-priest responsible for doctrinal purity and historical curation. Kessra controls which texts are preserved, which are reframed, and which quietly disappear. She is meticulous, unemotional, and deeply wary of historians and archivists. To her, truth is dangerous when mishandled, and ignorance can be an act of mercy.

The most controversial figure within the Faith is **[[Brother Caldus Renn]]**, a zealous inquisitor tasked with investigating “spiritual contamination.” Caldus pursues rumors of dream-fever, unapproved rituals, and forbidden symbols with unnerving enthusiasm. While officially sanctioned, his methods often push the limits of legality. Some believe he has uncovered genuine threats. Others believe he creates them by looking too hard.

The Lantern Faith maintains uneasy alliances across the city. The Council tolerates its influence because faith stabilizes the populace. The Collegium is watched closely, its experiments viewed as potential sources of spiritual imbalance. The Stonebound are quietly dismissed as superstitious. As for Somnurex and the old gods, the Faith insists they are relics—dangerous only if remembered.

### **What the Lantern Faith Wants**

The Lantern Faith wants **control through belief**. It seeks to maintain spiritual authority over Takari, suppress older religions, and ensure that fear flows toward obedience rather than curiosity. Above all, it wants the city to keep its eyes on the light—and never ask what the light is hiding.
