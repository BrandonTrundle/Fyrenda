The **Council of Takari** is the visible spine of the city’s governance, a body tasked with holding together a mountain city that has already vanished once. It is not a council of harmony, but of managed friction—eight seats representing competing necessities forced to coexist. Every decision must balance prosperity against safety, tradition against adaptation, and truth against panic. The council does not rule from confidence; it rules from _containment_.

At its center sits **[[Valla Rynn]]**, Mayor of Takari, whose authority is rooted less in politics and more in survival. She is not loved, but she is trusted—a rare and fragile distinction. Valla views the council as a tool, not a stage, and she is willing to override consensus when hesitation threatens the city. Her greatest fear is not rebellion, but indecision. Takari cannot afford to pause.

Opposite her influence stands **[[Leedra Vance]]**, the council’s sharpest economic mind and its most dangerous optimist. As the trade representative, Leedra believes Takari’s future depends on expansion, deeper investment, and aggressive control of Lumenfell ore markets. She frames every risk as calculable and every delay as lost opportunity. While not openly reckless, her patience for caution grows thinner with each stalled proposal.

Representing law and long memory is **[[Dethrick Thornwall]]**, the council’s quiet counterweight. He speaks rarely, but when he does, it is with the weight of precedent and consequence. Dethrick remembers Takari’s near-collapse better than most, not through stories but through records he personally authenticated. His goal is not progress, but _continuity_. If Takari survives another century unchanged, he considers that success.

The council’s arcane and historical conscience is embodied in **[[Zozno Kalarsh]]**, whose presence unsettles as much as it reassures. Zozno is brilliant, perceptive, and uncomfortably attuned to forces beneath the city that others prefer to ignore. While his seat grants him authority, it also isolates him; few councilors fully trust someone who admits the mountain is listening. Still, when matters turn strange, all eyes eventually shift to him.

[[Father Thorne]]'s presence on the **Council of Takari** is tolerated, not welcomed. He holds the Faith Seat by necessity rather than consensus, representing a significant portion of the city’s population who look to the Lantern Faith for reassurance during endless night. Removing him would fracture public trust. Keeping him risks inflaming it.

[[Julia Bramblewood]] serves as the city’s institutional memory and its most inconvenient conscience. As the Educative Magistrate, she is responsible for historical preservation, public knowledge, and scholarly oversight—but in practice, her role is to remind the council of what it would rather forget. Julia routinely grounds debates in precedent, archived disaster reports, and suppressed records, forcing policy discussions to confront the consequences of past decisions.

As the Councilor of Infrastructure and City Works, **[[Dekra Billinger]]** is responsible for the physical survival of Takari itself. She oversees tunnels, seals, lifts, aqueducts, bridges, and every load-bearing decision that keeps the city standing. Dekra approaches governance as an engineering problem shaped by historical failure; she cross-references modern stress fractures with ancient collapse patterns and is often the first to recognize when the city is repeating old mistakes. 

On the **Council**, [[Brennor Stoneward]] serves as the military voice of consequence. He represents the Takarian Guard not as a political faction, but as a reality check—regularly reminding the council what their decisions cost in blood, exhaustion, and readiness. While he rarely dominates discussions, his support or opposition carries significant weight, particularly when Mayor Valla Rynn defers to his judgment on matters of defense and crisis response.

### **What the Council of Takari Wants**

The council wants **stability without stagnation**. It seeks to preserve Takari’s prosperity while preventing another collapse, even if that means suppressing uncomfortable truths. Above all, the council wants control—of information, of resources, of panic. Whether that control is enough to withstand what stirs beneath the Lumenfell Mountains remains an open question.
