## **The Council of Takari**

- **The Sealed Vote:**  
    A critical infrastructure vote is rushed through the Council while Dekra is absent. Within days, tremors begin in a district she had previously condemned. Someone falsified her seal—proving either political sabotage or access to Council-level authority.
    
- **Faith vs Steel:**  
    Father Thorne publicly accuses the Council of defying divine warning by keeping certain tunnels open. Riots begin in the Lower Ward, forcing the Council to choose between appeasing faith or enforcing order.
    
- **The Missing Minutes:**  
    Entire records of a Council session vanish from the archives. The topics discussed align suspiciously with current Underdark movements. Someone doesn’t want the city to remember what it already decided.

## **The Lumenfell Consortium**

- **The Depth Initiative:**  
    Consortium surveyors quietly begin mapping a “previously unknown” tunnel system—one that Dekra insists was sealed centuries ago. Their maps don’t match the city’s records, and neither side is lying.
    
- **The Lumenfell Ore Surge:**  
    A new vein produces Lumenfell ore with unstable resonance, wildly profitable but dangerously erratic. The Consortium wants certification fast. The Collegium refuses. Someone starts selling it anyway.
    
- **Insurance of the Damned:**  
    A mining accident wipes out an entire shift—but the Consortium pays compensation immediately, far faster than expected. The speed suggests they _knew_ it would happen.

## **Vance Industries**

- **Hostile Acquisition:**  
    A small merchant house is swallowed overnight by Vance Industries. Their last shipment included artifacts recovered from sealed tunnels. Leedra claims ignorance. The Guard finds blood in the warehouse.
    
- **The Black Route:**  
    A smuggling path bypasses Guard checkpoints entirely. It doesn’t exist on any map, but it’s moving goods faster than official routes. Someone inside the city infrastructure is helping.
    
- **Leverage Play:**  
    Leedra offers to “solve” a food shortage—if the Council grants her emergency authority over trade regulations. The famine is real. The timing is not.

## **The Stonebound**

- **The Wrong Collapse:**  
    A tunnel collapses in a way that violates every known stress model. Stonebound elders insist it was _cut_, not broken. Someone wanted that shaft closed—or opened.
    
- **Old Warnings:**  
    A dying miner leaves behind a carving matching symbols found in First Takarian ruins. Stonebound leaders debate whether revealing it will save lives or doom the city.
    
- **Strike Beneath the City:**  
    Stonebound crews refuse to work a section the Consortium insists is safe. Replacement labor goes missing within days.

## **The Lantern Faith**

- **The Inquisition List:**  
    Father Thorne authorizes a “spiritual audit” of citizens suffering dream-fever. Several names belong to respected officials. Resistance means heresy.
    
- **False Light:**  
    Lanterns across a district glow brighter than ever—then go dark simultaneously. The Faith claims sabotage. The Collegium claims resonance failure. The people panic.
    
- **The Relic Procession:**  
    The Faith unveils an ancient relic meant to “cleanse” the deep tunnels. Its symbols match Somnurex-era iconography. Someone rebranded the past.

## **The Lumenfell Collegium**

- **The Unauthorized Thesis:**  
    A student publishes findings suggesting dream resonance can be _stabilized_, not suppressed. The paper disappears. So does the student.
    
- **Containment Breach:**  
    A sealed experiment chamber opens from the inside. Nothing escapes—but something leaves marks on the wards, as if learning.
    
- **Political Certification:**  
    The Consortium pressures the Collegium to certify unstable Moonstone devices for “civic use.” Refusal threatens the Collegium’s funding.

## **The Archivist Circle**

- **The Redacted Year:**  
    Archivists discover an entire year missing from Takari’s historical timeline. Events before and after align too perfectly. Someone rewrote the city.
    
- **Buried Testimony:**  
    A field historian uncovers a First Takarian survivor’s account—written _after_ the disappearance. The document contradicts everything.
    
- **Archive Fire:**  
    A fire breaks out in a restricted wing of the Lantern Library. Only certain records burn. The fire spreads _against_ airflow.
    

---

## **The Dreambound Cult**

- **Shared Dream Event:**  
    Dozens of unrelated citizens describe the same dream on the same night: a door opening beneath the city. The Guard calls it hysteria. The Dreambound call it progress.
    
- **The Sleeper Cell:**  
    A respected official is revealed to be Dreambound—but they don’t know it yet. Their dreams have been guiding city policy unconsciously.
    
- **Ritual Drift:**  
    A ritual meant only to observe Drataria begins altering nearby tunnels. The Dreambound lose control of their own work.
    

---

## **The Takarian Guard**

- **The Quiet Patrol:**  
    An entire tunnel warden unit vanishes mid-shift. Their last report lists “no contact, no resistance.” The tunnel still exists.
    
- **Command Conflict:**  
    Brennor Stoneward orders a seal Dekra approved—only for Valla to countermand it under political pressure. Something gets through.
    
- **Internal Leak:**  
    Patrol routes are being predicted too accurately. Someone inside the Guard is feeding information, willingly or not.

## **Underdark Interlopers**

- **The Listening Tunnels:**  
    Interlopers begin carving channels that amplify sound upward. Whispers reach sleeping districts. Morale collapses.
    
- **The Proxy War:**  
    Interlopers manipulate surface factions into conflict, timing incursions during strikes, riots, or religious unrest.
    
- **The Old Road:**  
    A massive, ancient route beneath Takari begins opening itself—not through force, but alignment. Something is waking on _both_ sides.
