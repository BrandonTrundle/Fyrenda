# **Drataria**

### *The Dream-Realm of Somnurex*

Drataria is not simply a place—it is the lingering echo of a god’s broken heart. Formed from the dreams and nightmares of Somnurex as he lay sealed beneath the Lumenfell Range, this desert realm shifts with the tides of his subconscious. Every dune, every shadow, every grain of shimmering sand is shaped by centuries of longing, regret, and anger.

The sky hangs in a permanent twilight, washed in hues of red and violet that bleed across the horizon like bruised memory. A sun—distant, exhausted, and strangely unfocused—hovers forever overhead, neither setting nor rising. The wind carries a faint metallic taste, and when it sweeps across the desert, the sands glitter with the soft luminescence of dreamlight.

This is a world caught between waking and sleep, life and memory, creation and decay. A realm where the land remembers everything Somnurex cannot bear to face.

Though vast stretches of Drataria lie barren, the emptiness is broken by colossal rock formations that jut from the desert like the ribs of a forgotten titan. Some resemble coils of serpents fossilized mid-strike. Others take the vague outline of faces, figures, or tools—sculpted not by hands, but by the god’s residual emotions. Intelligent beings do live among these formations, though many are hermits who shun society, their minds shaped by centuries of isolation and divine whispers.

To travel through Drataria is to walk through the anatomy of a god’s grief. The land is haunted not by spirits, but by memories given form. And beneath it all, the River Somniri—Somnurex’s living blood—slices through the wasteland like a great, churning wound.

Drataria is beautiful.
Drataria is terrifying.
Drataria is alive.



## **Geography & The Desert Regions**

Drataria’s landscape is a vast, aching expanse of shifting sand and ancient stone—its geography sculpted not by erosion or time, but by Somnurex’s subconscious mind. The realm behaves like a living organism, reflecting the emotions of the dreaming god beneath the material plane. Every region carries its own quiet tension, its own strange logic, its own imprint of divine memory.

### **The Twilight Desert**

The Twilight Desert is the dominant biome of Drataria: a horizon-spanning wasteland where the sky glows in eternal red-violet hues. The light is soft yet oppressive, offering visibility without comfort. When winds whip across the dunes, the sand glimmers like powdered gemstones. These shimmering grains are not mineral—they are fragments of dreamstuff, the shredded remnants of Somnurex’s passing thoughts.

Travelers often report seeing movement on the edge of their vision. Sometimes it’s creatures. Sometimes it’s illusions. Sometimes it’s memories that don’t belong to them.

### **The Stone Giants**

Across the desert stand colossal natural formations—impossibly tall spires, twisted arches, broken domes, and jagged monoliths. At first glance, they look like geological wonders. But the closer one gets, the more they seem shaped by intention rather than nature.

Some resemble coiled serpents.
Some look like melted forges or shattered anvils.
Some hold faint impressions of humanoid figures frozen mid-scream.

These formations are the scars of Somnurex’s dreaming mind—each one a failed attempt to resolve an emotion he can no longer consciously process. Creatures often nest within them, using the stone’s natural shade as sanctuary from the scorching dreamlight.

### **Hermits of the Sands**

Drataria is not empty. Intelligent beings live here—some native, some transformed, some drawn through Somnurex’s dreams from other realms long ago. These hermits keep to themselves, carving out small lives in the shadows of the Stone Giants.

They are not inherently hostile, nor are they welcoming. Their minds are shaped by years of exposure to divine influence. Some speak in riddles, others in whispers, and a few barely speak at all. Many hoard relics or fragments of Takarian history, believing them to be keys for escaping the realm—or returning it to the god’s favor.

Those who survive long enough gain deep spiritual insight into the nature of Drataria, though at the cost of their own stability.

### **Emotional Weather**

The desert does not simply respond to heat or wind—it reacts to Somnurex’s emotions.

When he is restless, sandstorms erupt with almost supernatural ferocity, shredding visibility to nothing.
When he sinks into deeper dreaming, the desert quiets, and faint motes of shimmering light drift lazily through the air.
When he experiences anger, the very ground can vibrate, sending tremors through stone formations and causing dunes to shift violently.

Travelers speak of the unsettling sensation of being *watched* by the desert itself—not by creatures, but by the realm.

# **The River Somniri**

### *The Divine Lifeblood of Somnurex*

The River Somniri is the most sacred and feared feature of all Drataria. It is not a river in the mortal sense—no natural spring feeds it, no rainfall replenishes it, and no terrain dictates its course. It exists because Somnurex exists. It flows because he dreams.

Wherever it winds, the air grows colder, the light shifts to a deep metallic shimmer, and the scent of saltwater thickens in the nose. Its waters churn with a silvery-red hue, viscous and heavy, like celestial blood diluted with twilight. When viewed from above, faint pulses ripple through it—slow, steady, rhythmic— echoing the slumbering heartbeat of the god buried beneath the mountains of the waking world.

### **A River of Blood**

The Somniri is the manifestation of Somnurex’s divine essence. Though mortal scholars once described it as a “pulse,” the truth is much darker—it is his blood, flowing endlessly from the source of his dreaming. It is warm to the touch, briny like the ocean, and carries a strange heaviness that clings to the skin.

Flowing in a single direction across the entire realm, its speed rises and falls with Somnurex’s dream cycles. When he descends into a deeper dream, the waters calm, drifting with near-hypnotic stillness. But when his sleep is troubled—when memories bleed into nightmare—the river quickens, its surface splitting with violent currents that roar like a living thing.

In those moments, the creatures that inhabit the Somniri become restless.

### **The River’s Dwellers**

The Somniri is infested with beings of every shape and size—some dream-spawned monstrosities that manifested from Somnurex’s emotional turmoil, others remnants of the Takarians lost during the catastrophic ritual centuries ago. Many bear faint humanoid traits twisted into serpentine, aquatic, or alien forms.

Most are aggressive.
Some are unnervingly intelligent.
A few have been seen watching from the depths, waiting for something.

These creatures are drawn to the river’s power and are fiercely territorial, attacking anything that disturbs the waters’ surface.

### **Clerics of the Bloodflow**

The banks of the Somniri are patrolled by an ancient order of Yuan-Ti clerics—devotees of Somnurex whose faith is older than their mutations. They offer themselves for sacrificial rites, oversee rituals of cleansing and prophecy, and guard portions of the river with an almost religious fervor.

Their faith is not kind; it is desperate.
Some believe their devotion can soothe the god.
Others believe the sacrifices are necessary to keep his nightmares from spilling fully into Drataria.

Most no longer receive any divine response—but they continue, driven by tradition, fear, and the scraps of power that linger around the riverbanks.

### **Saltwater and Scent**

The Somniri smells like the ocean after a storm—salt, brine, and faint traces of copper. This smell carries for miles, guiding travelers whether they want to find the river or not. Those who breathe the river’s vapors for too long often experience dreamlike hallucinations. These hallucinations intensify whenever Somnurex shifts in his sleep.

### **The River as Boundary**

To many of Drataria’s inhabitants, the Somniri is less a river and more a barrier—a sacred line that marks the threshold between the god’s dreaming and his deepest wounds. Clans, hermits, and monsters alike avoid crossing it unless absolutely necessary. Those who dare often return changed, claiming to have glimpsed reflections of the past—some theirs, some not, some belonging to the god himself.

The Takarian Yuan-Ti believe that all life in Drataria ultimately flows back into the Somniri, just as all dreams eventually return to the dreamer.

# **Isskavuun**

### *The First City of Drataria, and the Throne of the Takarian Yuan-Ti*

Isskavuun stands as the greatest testament to what the Takarians became after their fall—a sprawling desert metropolis built atop divine sand, haunted memory, and ruthless hierarchy. Though Somnurex did not build the city entirely, his dreaming shaped its foundations. The rest was carved by the descendants of Durak Takari: the Yuan-Ti who survived the ritual and wandered the desert until their bodies began to change.

Today, Isskavuun is a maze of sandstone streets, shimmering banners, ritual smoke, and serpentine dominance. It is ancient, proud, violent, beautiful, and frightening all at once.

## **A City of Sand and Stone**

From afar, Isskavuun looks like a massive stone hive rising from the dunes. Sandstone structures, all flat-roofed and sun-bleached, extend as far as the eye can see. Carved windows—ellipses, slits, spirals, and arched holes—decorate nearly every home, giving the city a distinct, organic geometry inspired by the shapes of snakes, coils, and shed skin.

The closer one gets, the more the city feels alive:

* Warm winds carry the scent of spiced meats, fermented cactus wine, and incense.
* Drums echo across rooftops at all hours of the day.
* The sunlight reflects off polished obsidian tiles arranged in ritual patterns.
* Strange creatures slither through alley shadows.

A low, constant hum lingers in the air—a chorus of chanting, hissing, and whispered prayers that seems to emanate from the city itself.

## **Hierarchy Through Mutation**

In Isskavuun, status is determined not by birth, not by wealth, not even by devotion—but by how far one has mutated from human into serpent.

**More serpent = more power.**
**Less serpent = more expendable.**

Those who bear full serpentine heads, scales, elongated arms, or cobra hoods hold positions of influence. Those who still appear vaguely human live in cramped, sun-baked quarters on the city’s outer rings.

During festivals and rituals:

* The most serpent-like lead the processions
* The lesser-blooded carry offerings or food
* The near-humans are often chosen for sacrifice

The social hierarchy is brutal, unspoken, and deeply ingrained.

## **The Grand Pyramid of Durak (Dakur)**

At the heart of Isskavuun rises **Dakur**, the immense pyramid built in honor of Durak Takari. It is the tallest structure in Drataria and serves as the seat of Si’et’s power.

Wide, sweeping staircases lead up its sun-bleached sides, each step carved with scenes of the Takarians’ fall, mutation, and rise. From its summit, one can see the entire city—a sea of sandstone rooftops stretching across the desert like scales.

By day, Dakur casts a shadow that envelops the central district.
By night, braziers ignite its walls, making the pyramid glow like a serpent’s eye in the dark.

## **Festivals of Excess and Blood**

Isskavuun is loud, colorful, and violent—its festivals a reflection of both ancient Takarian culture and Yuan-Ti superstition.

**During major celebrations:**

* Tables sag under mountains of exotic fruits, roasted meat, spiced desert vegetables, and fermented drinks.
* Dancers wrapped in shimmering silks move in serpentine patterns.
* Drums thunder, flutes wail, and voices chant old Takarian hymns warped into new, hissing cadences.
* Processions wind through the narrow streets, led by priests carrying clay bowls filled with desert sand—symbolic remnants of the ritual that changed their people forever.

These festivals often end in sacrifice—either voluntary, coerced, or ritualistically selected.

## **The Egg-Rite of the Broken Future**

The most feared and sacred ritual is the **Egg-Rite**, performed once per generation.

A female Yuan-Ti sits atop a stack of eggs—symbols of legacy, renewal, and the Takarian line. The populace, dressed in shimmering robes and carrying pouches of desert sand, marches through the streets in a slow, rhythmic procession.

At the base of Dakur, they form a vast circle.
The drums stop.
The crowd falls silent.

Then, one by one, they pour their sand over the eggs.

The female defends them, hissing, striking, crying out—but it is useless. She has been chosen. The eggs will perish, just as the first Takarians perished on the material plane.

This ritual represents:

* The death of what they once were
* The acceptance of what they became
* A reenactment of the ritual that birthed their new existence

It is not just tradition.
It is identity.

## **Arguments in the Streets**

Isskavuun’s people are passionate and volatile. Their arguments erupt with sudden intensity—sharp hisses, flared hoods, open-mouthed displays of dominance. When tempers rise, the distinctive growl of a cobra echoes through the streets, a warning from one serpent-blooded citizen to another.

Disputes often escalate to violence.
They also end just as quickly.

Life in Isskavuun is always one heartbeat away from chaos.

<img src="https://imgur.com/zIotSNr.jpeg" style="width:300px">

## **Si’et Takari**

### *The Serpent-King of Isskavuun*

Si’et Takari is the apex of Takarian evolution—everything the ritual made possible, everything the desert reforged, everything Drataria demanded. He is not merely the ruler of Isskavuun. He is its embodiment. Its blade. Its voice. Its hunger.

Where the lesser Yuan-Ti cling to old Takarian culture or struggle against their monstrous instincts, Si’et embraces every part of what they became. He is the perfect fusion of man and serpent—strong, cunning, disciplined, and terrifyingly ambitious.

He is a leader forged by a thousand years in a world shaped by heartbreak and divine neglect.

### **Visage of a Warlord**

Si’et is a towering figure with the upper body of a man carved from living obsidian—muscular, poised, effortlessly deadly—and the head of a cobra. His hood flares wide when angered, displaying patterns reminiscent of ancient Takarian runes. His eyes shine with a pale, venomous gold, unblinking and predatory. Those who meet his gaze often speak of feeling small, exposed, as though he can see straight through to their intentions.

He dresses unlike any other Yuan-Ti.
While they favor ceremonial silks, beads, or bone, Si’et wears only flared white silken trousers—nothing else. His chest and arms are bare, marked with ritual scars and faint, scale-like patterns that glint in the twilight light. His attire is not arrogance—it is a declaration that no weapon, no armor, no mantle strengthens him more than what he already is.

### **Mind of a Battlemaster**

Si’et is a tactician of rare brilliance. His mind is cold, analytical, and razor-sharp. He studies threats the way a snake studies prey—patiently, without blinking, without revealing intent until the perfect moment to strike.

He knows:

* how to rally a crowd
* how to break a rebellion
* how to read a foreigner’s body language
* how to manipulate through silence
* how to exploit weakness

He leads not through fear alone, but through competence. His people do not just obey him—they **trust** him. His strategies have kept Isskavuun fed, defended, and unified for centuries.

## **Ruthlessness Without Hesitation**

Si’et does not tolerate disobedience.
He does not suffer traitors.
He kills without remorse when it serves the city.
Yet… he never kills without reason.

There is purpose to every violent decision he makes. His cruelty is not emotional—it is calculated. It is an extension of his leadership, not a flaw in it. This makes him far more dangerous than a tyrant driven by impulse.

Isskavuun does not fear Si’et.
They **rely** on him.

## **The Ambition that Consumes Him**

At his core, Si’et is driven by something deeper than authority or survival.

**He craves power.
He craves destiny.
He craves the world beyond Drataria.**

Unlike the other Yuan-Ti, who have accepted the desert as their home—or their prison—Si’et sees Drataria for what it truly is:

**A cage built from another god’s dreaming.
A cage he intends to break.**

He does not hate Somnurex for trapping him here.
He hates that Somnurex’s dreams control the world around him.
He hates the unpredictability, the emotional storms, the delusions of divine sleep affecting the land.
He hates being subordinate to a god's subconscious whims.

Si’et wants a world he can rule with intent, not endure under someone else’s subconscious. This alone is enough to make him dangerous.

# **The Temple of Lysdara**

### *The Heartbreak at the Center of Drataria*

The Temple of Lysdara stands as the purest and most painful expression of Somnurex’s dreaming—a monument not to worship, but to memory. It was crafted in the deepest chambers of his subconscious, shaped by longing he never resolved, shaped by love he lost and still cannot let go.

The temple is not merely a building.
It is a confession carved in white stone.
It is a wound that never closed.
It is the dream of a god who never stopped loving the one who sealed him away.

## **A Temple Suspended Above a Wound**

The temple sits directly over the River Somniri, its foundation built upon an enormous arched tunnel that allows the divine blood to flow freely beneath it. The architecture is seamless—so precise that the river appears to part willingly around the temple, as if paying tribute to Lysdara herself.

On either side of the great tunnel stand colossal statues of Medusas—female figures with serpentine hair and unblinking stone eyes. These statues were once mere ornamentation in Somnurex’s dream, but when his heartbreak deepened, their eyes opened. Now they stand as eternal guardians, petrifying any who approach uninvited.

The Takarians call the temple the **Heart of Drataria**, believing that the god’s love—and his fury—reside within.

## **Marble That Bleeds**

The temple is built of radiant white marble, veined with bright crimson streaks that seem to pulse faintly in the twilight. These red lines are not paint, nor are they impurities. They are manifestations of Somnurex’s emotional agony—cracks in the marble that glow like bleeding wounds.

During Somnurex’s deeper dreaming cycles, the veins pulse brighter, illuminating the temple in a dull red glow that reflects off every surface of Isskavuun. In these moments, even the bravest Yuan-Ti refuse to look upon it. They avert their eyes, bow their heads, and whisper prayers of caution.

## **The Ziggurat of a Broken God**

Architecturally, the temple resembles a massive step-pyramid—a ziggurat with four towering pillars at each corner. These pillars vanish into the heavens, so tall that the uppermost sections fade into the red-violet haze.

The ziggurat steps narrow as they ascend, creating an unnerving visual perspective: no matter where one stands, the temple appears to be leaning slightly toward them, as if watching.

At the summit lies a wide, open chamber with no roof. Here, the eternal sun shines directly into the center of the structure, illuminating a massive stone dial carved into the floor.

This dial represents Somnurex’s impossible wish—to rewind time, to return to the moment before everything broke.

## **The Story of Somnurex and Lysdara**

In the material plane, their story is told as a tragedy: a god of dreams and a goddess of beauty who loved one another fiercely but drifted apart. But Drataria reveals a deeper truth—Somnurex never stopped loving her. Not even when she sealed him away. Not even after millennia.

The temple shows this in its structure:

* Beauty → reflected in white marble
* Vanity → reflected in its impossible scale
* Kindness → reflected in its open spaces
* Grief → reflected in its bleeding stone
* Longing → reflected in the sunlit dial at the summit

This is the memory he could not suppress, the emotion he could not bury. Drataria is his subconscious, and the temple is the place he cannot let go of.

## **Why It Is Sealed**

The temple has been sealed since the first Takarians arrived in Drataria. Not by magic they understand, but by a divine barrier formed from Somnurex’s heartbreak. The doors will not open—not to Si’et, not to the priests, not to the bravest warriors.

Only truths can open this place.
Only confrontation can break its seal.
Only acceptance can loosen its walls.

This is not just a structure.
It is a test.
\page

## **The Guards of the Heart**

Armed guardians patrol the exterior—a mixture of divine constructs, dream-forged creatures, and statues awakened by Somnurex’s subconscious. The Medusa statues themselves animate when threatened. Their gaze does not merely petrify flesh—it petrifies memory. Victims become frozen versions of their strongest emotion.

Some become statues of rage.
Some statues of sorrow.
Some statues of terror.
Some statues of hope.

The temple is littered with them.

## **A Forbidden Sanctuary**

The Takarians have spent centuries trying to breach the temple’s entrance. Every attempt failed. Some warriors burned. Some turned to stone. Some simply vanished. Many believe this is the last remnant of the god’s tenderness—a place too painful for even him to face directly.

It sits untouched.
Unopened.
Unforgiving.

The people of Isskavuun fear it as much as they revere it.
